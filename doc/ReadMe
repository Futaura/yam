                     YAM 2.5 - Installation notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In contrast to YAM 2.4, YAM 2.5 is distributed as "one archive per platform".
This approach assures that nobody is missing any optional archive.


Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
YAM 2.5 not only uses newer configuration files, the files used to store
separate emails are named differently as well. Therefore, before you start
the installation script, it's strongly recommended that you create a
backup of your old YAM directory, including all folders and configuration
files. Now you can install the update into your old YAM directory if you
wish. YAM 2.5 will automatically convert your old configuration files to
the new 2.5 format, and after being started, YAM will rename your old
emails as necessary, always under your control. It is also recommended
that you re-save your configuration as soon as possible in order to
update your .config file to the new format, which will reveal all the
new options available.


Source code
-----------
Due to lack of time and motivation, Marcel stopped working on YAM back in
2000, but the sources were released under the GNU General Public License
at SourceForge.net. If you want to help developing this program further
or perhaps you are considering a port to a different operating system,
please consider joining the YAM Open Source team instead of doing it
on your own. Our homepage is at http://sourceforge.net/projects/yamos/
and there you will find out how to contact us. We want to hear from you!


What's new since YAM 2.4p1?
---------------------------
Here's a list (in alphabetical order) of the brave developers who have
contributed to this update:

              Alexey Ivanov       (AmiS)
              David Rey           (tactica)
              Guenther Nikl       (gnikl)
              Jens Langner        (damato)
              Joerg Strohmayer    (joergs)
              Olaf Barthel        (obarthel)
              Thore Boeckelmann   (tboeckel)

And here's a PARTIAL list of the major changes in this version with
respect to the previous official update:

- lots of bugs fixed
- overall stability and error tolerance has improved
- completely changed mail file nameing scheme to be independent of the
  file system being used (no more file comments)
- improved GUI feedback during mail transfers (non-blocking I/O)
- improved handling of foreign character sets via codesets.library
- support for AmiSSL v3
- optional embedded read pane instead of separate windows
- quick search bar for fast search in a folder
- a new toolbar which will be adjustable to your personal needs in the
  future
- import/export of LDIF and TAB or comma separated address books for
  exchange with foreign EMail clients
- cached images for faster access on slow machines
- integrated (bayesian) spam filter, which will adapt itself over the
  time (AKA: learning spam filter)
- themes management to adjust YAM to your preferred look
- enhanced UIDL support to avoid duplicate mails
- automatic update function for all required components
- lots of other improvement I don't remember right now :)


What is still missing?
----------------------
- lots of translators! YAM 2.4 featured lots of different languages, but
  due to the large amount of changed texts these catalogs are completely
  outdated. Especially support for such common languages as french, italian,
  spanish, etc is currently missing.
  If you are a native speaker of a language that YAM does not offer (anymore),
  then please contact us!!
- lots of documentation! As with the translation the documentation largely
  lags behind. Again, if you are a native speaker (even for english) and if
  you are interested in updating/writing YAM's documentation then please
  contact us!
