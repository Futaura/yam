                     YAM 2.5 - Installation notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To minimize download time, YAM 2.5 is distributed in five different LhA
archives which must be unpacked into the same directory before installation.

YAM25.lha        YAM 2.5 basic installation for 68020 processors or better,
                 includes installer and English manual
YAM25os4.lha     AmigaOS 4 version
YAM25mos.lha     MorphOS version
YAM25loc.lha     Foreign language support (catalogs and manuals)
YAM25con.lha     Additional graphics, ARexx scripts, etc.


Before you start the installation
---------------------------------
YAM 2.5 not only uses newer configuration files, the files used to store
separate emails are named differently as well. Therefore, before you start
the installation script, it's strongly recommended that you create a
backup of your old YAM directory, including all folders and configuration
files. Now you can install the update into your old YAM directory if you
wish. YAM 2.5 will automatically convert your old configuration files to
the new 2.5 format, and after being started, YAM will rename your old
emails as necessary, always under your control. It is also recommended
that you re-save your configuration as soon as possible in order to
update your .config file to the new format, which will reveal all the
new options available.

2000, but the sources were released under the GNU General Public License
at SourceForge.net. If you want to help developing this program further
or perhaps you are considering a port to a different operating system,
please consider joining the YAM Open Source team instead of doing it
on your own. Our homepage is at http://sourceforge.net/projects/yamos/

What's new since YAM 2.4p1?
---------------------------
Here's a list (in alphabetical order) of the brave developers who have
contributed to this update:

              Alexey Ivanov       (AmiS)
              David Rey           (tactica)
              Guenther Nikl       (gnikl)
              Jens Langner        (damato)
              Joerg Strohmayer    (joergs)
              Olaf Barthel        (obarthel)
              Thore Boeckelmann   (tboeckel)

And here's a PARTIAL list of the changes in this version with respect
to the previous official update:

- Fixed: the information bar didn't notify the user properly about
  a POP3 transference in progress. (damato)
- Fixed: YAM is now more resilient to running into serious trouble
  when running out of memory while loading the indices. (damato)
- Fixed: a "=00" in a quoted-printable message was converted to
  a NUL, thus preventing the rest of the message from being
  displayed; now it converts them to spaces. (damato)
- Fixed: on a PGP error, no longer refers the user to a log file
  that has been deleted. (damato)
- Fixed: now it's actually compliant with RFC 2047. (damato)
- Fixed: the configuration now accepts 5-digit numbers where
  appropriate (e.g. now you can use port 25000). (damato)
- Fixed: DIGEST-MD5 authentication now actually works as it
  should. (damato)
- Fixed: now notices a server that drops the connection immediately.
  (damato)
- Fixed: sound handling is now more system friendly and sounds are
  played asynchronously. (damato)
- Fixed: Enforcer hit when the YAM application icon had no tooltypes.
  (damato)
- Fixed: moving or copying emails didn't work too well when a XPK
  compressed or encrypted folder was involved. (damato)
- Fixed: Message-ID and Boundary ID numbers weren't as unique
  as they should, now they are; besides, Boundary ID generation
  code is now compliant with RFC 2045. (damato)
- Fixed: buffer overrun with very long boundary markers. (damato)
- Fixed: recipient string gadgets could delete one char too much
  when pressing <Backspace>. (damato)
- Fixed: the contents of the Filters-->Action-->Forward string gadget
  were never saved to disk. (damato)
- Fixed: an email in the Sent folder that was edited and then queued
  to be "sent later" was never moved to the Outgoing folder, it just
  remained hidden in the Sent folder. (damato)
- Fixed: Write windows closed successfully no longer leave orphan
  autosave files behind. (damato)
- Fixed: trying to save all the attachments in an email no longer
  opens the directory requester on Workbench when YAM is running
  on its own screen. (damato)
- Fixed: one could actually try to export a folder group, which would
  trigger a nice crash. (damato)
- Fixed: layout problems when switching between different pages in
  the configuration. (damato)
- Fixed: YAM will now automatically uniconify itself if it has to
  display an error requester. (damato)
- Fixed: searching in the address book no longer matches a given entry
  more than once. (damato)
- Fixed: the shortcut for the "Execute script..." menu item no longer
  clashes with the one used for Message-->Set status to-->Unmarked.
  (damato)
- Fixed: the "Execute script..." menu item now actually works with
  filenames containing spaces (requires rexxsyslib.library V45+).
  (damato)
- Fixed: the folder settings window is now guaranteed to be the frontmost
  window when it opens. (damato)
- Fixed: trying to attach a read protected file would silently fail.
  (damato)
- Fixed: no longer shuts down a Read window when MUI sends a change
  notification. (damato)
- Fixed: names resolved from the address book no longer make emails
  appear misplaced when sorting emails by name; also, this kind of
  name resolution can now be turned off completely. (damato)
- Fixed: the From: and Reply-To: headers can now contain multiple
  accounts, as it should have been from the beginning as per RFC 2822.
  (damato)
- Fixed: a double click on an entry in the address book opened
  by the popup gadgets next to Filters-->Action-->Bounce/Forward
  now actually adds that entry to the relevant string gadget.
  (damato)
- Fixed: now checks properly if a connection is already in use instead
  of just abruptly aborting the previous connection and starting a new
  one, which would e.g. make YAM abort a download in course started by
  the GETURL ARexx command if the user clicked the [Get mail] button.
  (tboeckel)
- Fixed: real names containing a comma are now properly double quoted
  when added to the address book. (damato)
- Fixed: no longer filters out .info files from the attachment file
  requester when the user explicitely wants them listed by editing
  the default pattern. (damato)
- Fixed: when selecting an attachment with the file requester, it
  no longer keeps the directory locked until exit. (damato)
- Fixed: ARexx scripts invoked on the "After writing a message"
  event couldn't really edit the message before being sent (later).
  (damato)
- Fixed: filtering email to a password protected folder no longer
  leaves the folder in unprotected state. (tboeckel)
- Fixed: the email cache no longer accepts real names containing
  commas without being double quoted. (tboeckel)
- Fixed: when replying to several messages with the same Subject: header,
  now the subject isn't repeated. (tboeckel)
- Fixed: no longer iconifies itself when "Close gadget iconifies
  program" is turned off and the user uses the close gadget
  and then answers "No" to a confirmation requester. (tboeckel)
- Fixed: real names containing "<" or ">" are now double quoted on
  replies. (tboeckel)
- Fixed: rewritten UIDL management; the ".uidl" file can no longer
  grow out of control over time and the whole lookup process is faster.
  (damato, tboeckel)

- Changed: now handles differently the status of emails to fix some
  odd problems, pave the way for IMAP-4 and no longer depend on the
  comment field for metadata (which doesn't travel well along filesystems
  like NFS); this made also necessary to change the way emails
  are named on disk, thus requiring an update of all indices.
  As a bonus, the status of emails (read, unread, etc.) is now
  preserved when importing/exporting email by means of the "Status:"
  and "X-Status:" headers. (damato)
- Changed: the gauges in the mail transference and search windows were
  updated too frequently, now they are updated at most twice a second
  to speed up processing especially on fast machines. (obarthel, damato)
- Changed: now handles gracefully "7-bit", "8-bit" and "plain" as
  Content-Transfer-Encoding to support flawed emailers that keep
  violating the RFCs. (damato)
- Changed: very large strings that don't fit in the title bar of the
  Read window have now trailing dots ("...") appended at the end
  of the displayable part. (damato)
- Changed: encoded words between double quotes are now accepted
  to support broken email clients that keep violating RFC 2047.
  (damato)
- Changed: the user will be now consulted when an unknown file is
  found in a mail folder, useful to e.g. quickly copy a certain email
  without resorting to importing. (damato)
- Changed: YAM now supports full SMTP SSLv3 compatibility and the
  authentication method used by SMTP AUTH is now user definable to
  work around servers that claim to support methods they can't
  actually handle. (damato)
- Changed: now checks if the "(a)rchived" bit has been set on
  both the .index file and on the mail directory and if so it
  doesn't rebuild the index despite the modified timestamps,
  assuming the user has simply used a backup program. (damato)
- Changed: increased the limits for the length of attachment
  filenames and paths to 107 and 1024 bytes respectively. (damato)
- Changed: removed the old limit of max. 4 read windows open at once
  when "Multiple windows" is selected; now an arbitrary number of Read
  windows (memory permitting) can be opened at once. (damato)
- Changed: user images in the Read window are now scaled as appropriate
  and thus no longer need a scrollbar. (damato)
- Changed: for safety, holding the <Del> key down will only delete
  exactly one email now. (damato)
- Changed: by default, the folder list now uses bold and grey
  text to mark folders with new and unread email, respectively;
  in addition, if the columns listing the number of new or unread
  emails are turned off, this number will be shown between parentheses
  right after the folder name, but this is all user definable. (damato)
- Changed: no longer considers emails with empty CC: or BCC:
  headers (Hotmail) as emails being sent to multiple recipients.
  (damato)
- Changed: now considers unknown multipart subtypes as "multipart/
  mixed" to be more compliant with RFC 2046. (damato)
- Changed: removed the max. 100 filter limit; also, filters are no
  longer limited to 2 rules each. (damato)
- Changed: now accepts "=?" strings in headers without whitespace
  in front as specified by RFC 2047. (damato)
- Changed: if an autosave file is found on startup, a requester
  opens to let the user decide what to do with it. (damato)
- Changed: now uses a fixed width font in the signature editor.
  (damato)
- Changed: emails with an empty "Content-Type:" header would cause
  no content at all to be displayed for them; now they are considered
  as "text/plain". (damato)
- Changed: now takes the first non-binary MIME part in an email as the
  real email content to be displayed when LetterPart points to a binary
  part. (damato)
- Changed: the contents of the error window can now be marked & copied
  to the clipboard. (damato)
- Changed: URL highlighting now works as per RFC 3986. (damato)
- Changed: malformed MIME base64 parts that happen to be readable text
  will still be displayed now, and an error will be thrown to warn
  the user. (damato)
- Changed: when the "Exchange mail" feature is invoked, YAM now first
  downloads new mail to avoid clashing with servers using the
  "SMTP-after-POP3" security feature. (damato)
- Changed: added a workaround for AmigaOS 3.x users using MUI 3.8
  which made the TCP/IP page in the configuration to be partially
  ghosted. (damato)
- Changed: reworked MIME type management, removing the old internal
  limit of max. 100 MIME types, rendering binary identification
  redundant and finally making YAM fully compliant with RFC 2231. (damato)
- Changed: user selected headers in the "Read" page of the configuration
  are now printed in the same order the user typed them when the
  Read window is displaying "short headers". (damato)
- Changed: by default, the "short headers" string gadget in the
  Read configuration now also lists the CC: and BCC: headers.
  (damato)
- Changed: searches in the address book don't need AmigaDOS wildcards
  anymore, the input is always considered partial now. (damato)
- Changed: removed the possibility to download user images from the
  old YAM user gallery as that part of the site no longer exists and
  is considered obsolete. (damato)
- Changed: modal requesters (those that block all user input until
  satisfied) now share a common background pattern. (damato)
- Changed: the title of the mail transference window now quotes
  the full name of the account currently being cheched. (damato)
- Changed: the mail transference window now shows speed as KB/s instead
  of cps, and the gauge is now based on transference time rather than
  on the data already transferred, which as a bonus works around a bug
  in MUI 3.8 which would make the gauge to vanish when reaching about
  6.4 MB of transferred data. (damato)
- Changed: soft style markers in the text editor are now displayed
  to make it possible to correctly mark & copy the text from the
  editor; in addition, support for the old "<sb>" and "<tsb>" markers
  has been dropped as they aren't standard, though they are still
  interpreted if they are detected in an email. (damato)
- Changed: soft styles can now be only applied on a word by word
  basis and never several at once to a single word for better
  compatibility with non-Amiga mailers. (damato)
- Changed: no longer switches to the Outgoing folder before sending
  email. (damato)
- Changed: now complains if it finds a mismatching catalog, based on
  its version string. (damato)
- Changed: double clicking an email in the Outgoing folder now opens
  a Write window to edit it immediately. (damato)
- Changed: added a workaround to gracefully handle emails coming from
  broken emailers who don't use ";" to separate the different parts of
  a Content-Type: header. (damato)
- Changed: by default, real alternative parts of "multipart/alternative"
  emails are no longer handled as attachments to be more compliant with
  RFC 2046, but still listed in the email parts selector for the
  user's convenience. (damato)
- Changed: YAM is now more forgiving with suspicious Date: headers that
  break RFC 822. (damato)
- Changed: the info window that optionally opens after downloading new
  email no longer steals the focus. (tboeckel)
- Changed: options dependant upon XPK are now disabled if XPK isn't
  available. (tboeckel)
- Changed: if a signature is modified in the "Signature" page of the
  configuration and then the user switches to a different page, a
  requester will open asking if he/she first wants to save the
  signature (formerly YAM always saved the change without asking).
  (tboeckel)
- Changed: the "Next/Previous unread message" menu items now work in
  a circular fashion, i.e. "Next unread message" invoked on the last
  folder in the tree may open an unread message in the first folder.
  (tboeckel)
- Changed: aliases typed in the recipient strings used for mailing list
  support in a folder settings window are now resolved before the
  window is closed to avoid possible trouble later on. (tboeckel)
- Changed: removed the "Deny..." answers from the requester asking
  what to do with a message disposition notification. (tboeckel)
- Changed: dropped the "Return-Receipt-To:" header and made YAM
  compliant with RFC 3798. (damato)
- Changed: YAM no longer creates a "Deleted" folder, this folder is
  now called "Trash". (damato)
- Changed: extended output when calling YAM from the CLI with
  "YAM ?", also added the NOCATALOG switch. (damato)
- Changed: now gracefully handles SMTP servers that don't
  bother replying with a positive status code after getting
  a QUIT command from the client before actually dropping the
  connection (GoogleMail), clearly violating RFC 2821. (damato)
- Changed: extended AppIcon support wrt setting the icon
  position on Workbench. (tboeckel, damato)
- Changed: when sending email, now defaults to ESMTP before
  falling back to plain SMTP in case the server doesn't
  support the EHLO command. (damato)
- Changed: added a workaround for a MUI bug that would lead to a
  crash when switching folders while YAM is currently rebuilding
  an index. (tboeckel)
- Changed: HTTP requests don't send a From: header anymore. (damato)
- Changed: removed support for user-definable quotation marks as this
  causes more trouble than it's worth; now it will always use "> ".
  (damato)
- Changed: increased the default "size limit" for message
  preselection to 1024 KB. (damato)
- Changed: SMTP and POP3 error messages now quote the name
  of the server returning the error. (tboeckel)
- Changed: if a Write window is currently open, YAM will no
  longer quit without asking first when using the close gadget,
  even if "ConfirmOnQuit" is turned off in the configuration.
  (tboeckel)
- Changed: added a workaround to prevent YAM from crashing due
  to a MUI bug when started twice very quickly. (tboeckel)
- Changed: moved the message status icon group in the Read window to
  just underneath the toolbar and made it more informative. (damato)
- Changed: the name of the 4 most common headers (From, To, Date &
  Subject) are now localized in the Read window to match the
  headlines in the main window. (damato)
- Changed: the "About" window now uses Crawling.mcc to display credits
  that scroll automatically. (damato)
- Changed: turned this text file into a plain US-ASCII one to make it
  100% printable on all languages and charsets. (tactica)

- Added: user configurable spam filter! :) (tboeckel)
- Added: finally implemented non-blocking socket I/O, which
  should make the [Abort] button in the mail transference
  window actually work now! (damato)
- Added: the information bar may now show a small "X" button for
  functions that keep YAM busy to let the user abort the operation,
  making it possible for the first time ever to e.g. cancel a filtering
  operation. (damato)
- Added: integration of codesets.library, obsoleting the old translation
  tables and making it possible to e.g. read UTF-8 email. (damato)
- Added: support for AmiSSL v3, obsoleting AmiSSL v1. (damato)
- Added: each mail folder can now have assigned its own intro and
  close phrases, overriding the defaults set in the configuration.
  (AmiS)
- Added: embedded read pane (single window view), which will only
  flag the current email as read after a user defined amount of
  time. (damato)
- Added: attachments are now listed in a separate auto-sizable group
  at the bottom of the Read window or embedded read pane, complete with
  interactive icons, context menus and some related data. (damato)
- Added: search bar in the main window to limit the main view to a range
  of emails according to their sender, subject, etc. (damato)
- Added: simple HTML to RFC 822 converter to convert HTML mail to
  plain text at the user's discretion. (damato)
- Added: now can import single mail files in RFC 822 format as well
  as DBX mail files (Outlook Express). (damato)
- Added: possibility to import/export address books in LDIF, CSV
  or TSV formats. (tboeckel)
- Added: "Update" page in the configuration. (damato)
- Added: all the images are now loaded via system datatypes, and
  PNG is considered the default image format. (damato)
- Added: a double click in the header list of the Read window will now
  toggle between short and full header view. (damato)
- Added: now sends STATs to the POP3 server within an user defined
  interval of time to prevent the server from dropping the connection
  while the user is using the preselection window. (damato)
- Added: automatic local charset recognition. (damato)
- Added: possibility to set an amount of time PGP will remember the
  user's passphrase to avoid asking for it again and again. (damato)
- Added: "Look & feel" page in the configuration. (damato)
- Added: "Relative date output" option. (damato)
- Added: possibility to select the colour used to print the signature
  in the Read window. (damato)
- Added: new "%p" placeholder in the MIME configuration to return
  the name of the screen where YAM is running. (tboeckel)
- Added: tracking of temporary files that couldn't be deleted because
  something else is locking them (e.g. MultiView). YAM will try
  to delete them again every 5 minutes and finally on exit; if
  the latter also fails, a requester will be displayed as a last
  resort. (tboeckel)
- Added: unread email in a folder can now be made to "expire",
  just like read email. (tboeckel)

  folder. (damato)
- Added: new "SocketOptions" and "TRBufferSize" options in the
  configuration to finetune the communication. (damato)
- Added: "JumpToRecentMsg" option in the configuration to make YAM
  jump to the most recent message instead of the last active message
  when switching folders. (tboeckel)
