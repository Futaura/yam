The YAM.debug and YAM.map file you will find in this archive
are just for debugging purposes. They are NOT meant to be used
permanently. Just in case a YAM developer requests from you to
run the debug version you should need to have it installed
together with tools like 'SegTracker', 'Enforcer' and 'Sashimi'.
With the help of the debug information we might gain from these
debug versions our developer can more easily find and fix bugs.
