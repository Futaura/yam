    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.
