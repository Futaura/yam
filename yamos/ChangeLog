    * ContextMenus now also open in areas where no mail/folder is, so that this
      popupmenus can be used to generate at least a new folder/group or mail.
    * If a context menu is opened on a already active entry the maillist will
      not be refreshed anymore. This should reduce flickering at least on
      already active entries.

2001-08-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Now respects the "Iconified on startup" MUI setting. If the HIDE
      tooltype is present, it'll override it.

2001-08-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the delete folder menu item & context menu entry does not allow to remove
      the incoming/deleted/sent/outgoing folder anymore. This was the standard
      behaviour before the hierarchical folder system was added and was broken.
      This fixes bug #445602 also.
    * if a folder group is going to be deleted YAM will pop up a requester now
      asking the user to confirm if it is not empty. If this folder group
      contains any subfolders or another group, then this subentries will be
      moved to the parent folder of the group first.
    * reverted changes to the resolve method of the recipientstring to reduce
      complexity of the code. (who requested this... guess?)
    * turned the ChangeLog upsidedown. Now the newest entry should always be
      attached to the top because this is more natural.

2001-08-05  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed enforcer hit in Recipientstring class («censored»).
    * ResolveOnCR defaults to FALSE similar to AdvanceOnCR.
    * Pressing 'delete' in a recipient string will now delete close the popup
      list.
    * The mails in the main listview are now shown to be from the real name
      of the sender found in your addressbook (this name should also be used
      when replying to the letter and composing the greeting phrase, but is
      currently not).
    * Removed classes/Classes.h dependency from class sources!
    * Added ClassesExtra.h file.
    * Added section about tags and compact switch/cases to the styleguide.
    * Moved the address list popup window to its own class.
    * The adddress list popup window will now adapt to the position and size
      of the parent window, when changed.
    * Escape will now close the address matchlist popup window (and
      MUIKEY_WINDOW_CLOSE is disabled for the recipient string as long as the
      window is open).

2001-08-02  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Recipientstring class no longer sets the frame, cyclechain or 'advance
      on cr' tags.
    * Ensured that all source descriptions are now prefixed with ' Module:'.
      This allows e.g. to do a »Search YAM_#?.c "*N Module:"« to see the
      description of each source file.

2001-08-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added a MUIA_Recipientstring_NoResolve attribute to the recipientstring
      class. If this attribute is set to TRUE the recipientstring is not going
      to perform a resolving on the entered string, what means in fact that it
      will not transform it with a realname or something else.
    * fixed some bugs recently introduced to the recipientstring class.
    * the recipient string class now only set the focus on the next object
      if the MUIA_String_AdvanceOnCR is set.
    * renamed the MUIA_Recipientstring_Resolve_NoResolve to _ResolveOnCR
      accordingly to some discussions.
    * renamed GetMUI() function to xget() because this is a more "standard"
      name for this function.
    * the ShowMatches() method of the recipient string class is now using
      SetAttrs() for setting the list position.
    * added EXPORT statement for the MUIF_ flags to the recipient string class
      to allow the autogen tool to take care about this.
    * removed obsolete DD_String class stuff including WR_ResolveName() and
      WR_ExpandAddresses()
    * modified smakefile to reflect every dependency for the classes.

2001-08-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * changed RETURN, SHIFT+RETURN behaviour as discussed in the mailing list.
      Now YAM should resolve any entered string without the realname if the user
      press SHIFT+RETURN in a recipientstring gadget.
    * changed the string gadget checks if a mail is going to be sent accordingly
      to the above behaviour. Now YAM will pop up an error requester if a user
      tries to send a email and it can`t resolve any entered string or if the
      From: is missing.
    * YAM will also change the focus of the pagegroup and string gadget that
      produced the failure, so that the user can immediatly change it.
    * added From: is missing warning requester. Now YAM will warn the user that
      the From: string is empty and allow him to either use the default sender
      address from the config or reenter the string again.
    * fixed bug in recipient string where the position of the popuplist was not
      set everytime it was opened. This caused that if the window was moved in
      between of two popups, then the popuplist was displayed on a wrong position.
      Still one flaw:
      1)if the window is moved while the popuplist ist open, then the popuplist
        will not move it`s position in sync with the window.

2001-08-01  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_rexx.c (global): added REXXMSG macro to hide annoying NDK difference
      (ReplyRexxCommand, DoRXCommand): use it
    * YAM_rexx.c: small cleanups

2001-07-31  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Addressbook popup gadget is no longer in cyclechain as you can popup the
      book with the standard MUI popup key (defaults to ctrl-p) -- I really
      would prefer to turn it into a real Popstring gadget, but currently the
      hook to open the address book require both global and local info etc.
    * Each change of the recipient string will result in an attempt of
      completing the address which is in front of the cursor. Earlier e.g.
      deleting a character wouldn't.
    * The recipient class now has a tag for "allow multiple recipients". This
      is enabled for the From and Reply-To strings (which it wasn't earlier).
    * The recipient class has a method to resolve the names entered. The
      MakeRecipients() function setup a notify on MUIA_String_Acknowledge to
      call this method.
    * When resolving a list then it will recursively continue to expand
      members of this list so one can have a list of lists. Though this is
      currently limited to 5 recursions.
    * The 'resolve' gadget has been removed (since it happens on return anyway
      in the writewindow) and thus the 'focus on return' scheme has been
      removed entirely.
    * There's now a popup list when YAM attempts to complete what the user is
      typing in a recipient string. It contain 3 columns for alias, real name
      and address. The entire string of the column which match what the user
      is entering is in bold, though limited to SIZE_ADDRESS characters due
      to the static display hook buffer. The list is sorted accodring to which
      field match and secondly alphabetically.
    * Using arrow up/down when the popup list is open immidiately change the
      contents of the string gadget and pressing return will act as if the
      popup wasn't shown (i.e. it will be interpreted by the gadget, so
      MUIA_String_Acknowledge will go high).
    * As with the old class one can enter a comma while text is marked (during
      a completion) and the comma will be inserted behind the marked text
      instead of overwriting it.
    * The alias, real name and address stringgadgets of the addressbook (new
      user, new list and new group windows) no longer accept comma as a valid
      character.
    * The stringgadget for entering list members (in the list window of the
      addressbook) is now a Recipientstring. It doesn't auto-transform on
      return (since often you want the alias in the list, so that a change to
      the address of this alias will also affect the list). Also, it currently
      lack the addressbook gadget. This is only because I was lazy when I
      added it... we could just cut'n'paste the code from MakeRecipient(), but
      I want this Recipientstring to instead be a popuplist which handle the
      addressbook itself.
    * Put the Okay gadget in the (stupid) subject warning requester as default
      (didn't I already do that?).
    * Trim() now accepts a NULL pointer (returns NULL).
    * Added a STR() define to YAM_utilities.h. This transforms a define into a
      string. This is useful e.g. if you do sprintf and want to limit the
      string length to that of a define. E.g. in the AB_PrettyPrint() function
      I do the following:
         static TEXT buf[SIZE_REALNAME + SIZE_ADDRESS + 4];
         sprintf(buf, "%." STR(SIZE_REALNAME) "s <%." STR(SIZE_ADDRESS) "s>",
            e->RealName, e->Address);
    * Added DUFF define to smakefile -- I'll soon remove the define, but my
      code has made a lot of functions obsolete and I'm going to wait a little
      before I start to remove all this code (which is currently marked by an
      #ifndef DUFF).
    * One can go back in the recipientstring gadget and change previous
      entries, even with name completion (earlier that would delete the rest
      of the string). The completion will only kick in if the character under
      the cursor is '\0' or ','.

««« Some bugs/flaws which remain: »»»

[FIXED] ADDRRESOLVE arexx command is currently broken. Reason is that I have
        retired the WR_Resolve() function which this command require. Suggested
        solution is that the command simply create a Recipientstring objectc,
        set the alias as contents in this object and calls the
        MUIM_Recipientstring_Transform method.
[FIXED] When using a list in the To gadget then the From and Reply-To fields
        won't be changed to that setup in the addressbook. Reason: this was
        really a hack before IMHO (testing various pointers to figure if and
        where to set the new strings). Also, some problems arise if letter is
        sent to multiple lists. Suggested solution would be to introduce
        two tags which tell the recipientstring object which object(s) it should
        propagate the (new) From and Reply-To addresses.
      * When typing the last character of an alias (while the popup list is
        open) then the popup list won't close. Reason being that the
        Recipientstring class doesn't notice that the string change (user
        overwrites last marked character with same character).
      * There's currently no warning requester when one of the recipient strings
        can't resolve the names (but a DisplayBeep(NULL) and a
        "DB(kprintf();)").

    * Renamed MUIM_Recipientstring_Transform method to
      MUIM_Recipientstring_Resolve for consistency with the rest of the YAM
      source.
    * Fixed ADDRRESOLVE arexx command further. Btw: this command would earlier
      (YAM 2.2) return a random string on failure.

2001-07-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug #440000. Now the NListtree default foldergroup icons will be
      displayed if one of the folder_fold/unfold images are missing.
    * fixed bug #445715. YAM should now not change the Track Message flag if
      a message is going to edit.
    * WR_WriteUserInfo() now takes respect of the alternative selected From:
      address of the folder the mail was created in.

2001-07-29  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Rewrote the eventhandler of the recipient string. The new code should be
      much simpler and thus more transparent.
      Some functionality still lack and it needs some finetuning (e.g.
      multiple recipient support)...

2001-07-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Changed code layout of the new classes files accordingly to the standard
      layout of YAM and added the fold/unfold marks.

2001-07-28  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Moved the Recipient String class to its own file
      (classes/Recipientstring.c) and added a popup window when multiple
      candidates exist for address completion. Some functionality is still
      pending (you can navigate the list with arrow up/down but return just
      does a DisplayBeep()) -- you need to define DUFF for this to work.

2001-07-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed possible enforcer hit in YAM_FO.c where the destructor of
      the folder listtree called FO_FreeFolder and tried to remove a Object
      with a InitChange where this Group doesn`t exists anymore.
    * change addressfield completion accordingly to some discussions on the
      mailinglist. if you now press SHIFT+RETURN after entering a string that
      matches a addressbook entry to should not complete it with the realname.
      Also if you send a mail it will not complete already valid email addresses.

2001-07-24  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Centered the checkmark (and label) in the search window.

2001-07-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * change MA_ExamineMail() to only check for uuencoded attachments if the
      header itself doesn`t tell us that this mail in a MULTIPART mail.
      This should speed up the "update index" as well as the download of mail
      a bit.
      Also removed the maximum check of the first 30 lines for a UUE check
      of a mail.
    * added missing status_flags to the Status Group of the read window. Now
      it should show all statuses accordingly to the message status

2001-07-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed MUIA_NList_Quiet calls in DisplayMailList YAM_UT.c because
      this will speed up the insertion of items for 3-4 seconds with ~6000
      items. (This is a strange behaviour of the NList class itself)

2001-07-18  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed some wrong RexxMsg types.
    * Enhanced the output of the smake process and also did other minor
      changes to the smakefile (e.g. cleanall now use clean).
    * When DEBUG is enabled NewReadArgs.c includes YAM_debug.h.
    * mail is set to NULL to get rid of that 'uninitialized' warning.
    * Added Classes.c,h to the repository, though these files are
      auto-generated (so they'll go again when I add the auto-generate tool).
    * Re-added Searchwindow.c with uppercase 's' to the repository.
    * Enabled Searchwindow.c in smakefile, since it should compile.
    * The 'search' function of the write window now works. There's only one
      search window (in the global structure) which should probably also be
      used if anyone adds search to the readwindow.

2001-07-17  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * Makefile: renamed revision 1.12 to Makefile.MorphOS 
    * Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: renamed revison 1.14 to Makefile
    * Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS-ixemul: deleted

2001-07-17  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (struct Args): fixed GCC cpp problem

    * YAM.c, YAM_addressbookEntry.h, YAM_main.h, YAM_utilities.h, YAM_write.h
      includes/proto/genesis.h: fixed GCC warnings

2001-07-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced "remailer@replay.com" in YAM_CO.c with a uptodate remailer,
      because replay.com no longer provides a remailer service.

2001-06-29  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_hook.h: use proper types in hook casts, change placement of SAVEDS
      in DISPATCHERPROTO to match other uses, added cast for ENTRY argument in
      AmigaOS case

    * YAM_utilities: added OUT_DOS define as replacement for incorrect NULL
      usage
    * YAM_MA.c: (MA_ExecuteRuleAction,MA_StartMacro): use OUT_DOS
    * YAM_TR.c: (TR_ApplyRemoteFilters,TR_NewMailAlert): likewise

    * YAM_rexx.c: (DoRXCommand) likewise

    * YAM_UT.c: (putCharFunc) change parameter type from "char" to "int"

    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: changed RESINDEX to utilize stddef.h/offsetof()

    * extrasrc/dice.c: added test for VBCC
    * includes/extra.h: more general access() handling

    * added all_vbcc.c, inlines/*_protos.h and VMakefile

2001-06-25  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Added MyAddHead() function to YAM_UT.c.
    * When reading folder contents messages are now added to the head of the
      list rather than the tail. This makes reading large folder index much
      faster (since AddTail is O(n)), however NList layout is still required,
      so it's still painfully slow...

2001-06-24  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * YAM.c Added proper exitcode and modified Abort()
    * Added classes directory, moved Searchwindow_class to this as
      searchwindow.c, modified smakefile to support this, disabled it
      in smakefile, as it does not yet compile (remove # in CLASSES line
      to enable again)

2001-06-22  Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * Fixed toolbar init code (uses "tb_butt[i]." instead of const "p->").
    * Added extra toolbar button to write window (search) -- nop ATM.
    * Added new source to the repository (Searchwindow_class.c).

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_utilities.h: added "struct NewToolbarEntry"
    * YAM_AB.c (AB_New): merged tb_butt[] and tb_help[] using that struct
    * YAM_MA.c (MA_New): likewise
    * YAM_RE.c (RE_New): likewise
    * YAM_WR.c (Wr_New): likewise

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_read.h: (struct RE_GUIData) fixed wrong toolbar array size,
      was off by one since at least YAMos 2.2 ...
    * YAM_utilities.h: added ARRAY_SIZE define
    * YAM_AB.c (AB_New): use it
    * YAM_EA.c (EA_New): likewise
    * YAM_MA.c (MA_New): likewise
    * YAM_RE.c (RE_New): likewise
    * YAM_WR.c (Wr_New): likewise

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM_AB.c,YAM_CL.c,YAM_CO.c,YAM_COg.c,YAM_COs.c,YAM_EA.c,YAM_FI.c,
      YAM_MA.c,YAM_RE.c,YAM_TR.c,YAM_US.c,YAM_UT.c,YAM_WR.c,
      YAM_rexx_rxif.c: added missing "extra.h", fixed double inclusion
      and corrected its usage

2001-06-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * smakefile: added OPTCOMPLEXITY=5 OPTDEPTH=3 to OPTFLAGS,
      created LNKFLAGS
    * makeall.ados: removed MAP file renaming since smakefile already
      creates the "correct" one, fixed scompare statements
    * Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: removed "-c" from $(CDEFS)
    * YAM_RE.c: (RE_SendMDN) added const qualifier
    * YAM_COg.c: (CO_Page7) fix formatting
    * YAM_COs.c: (CO_Save) likewise
    * YAM_UT.c: (CloneWorkbenchPath) likewise
    * YAM_WR.c: (MIMewarn,PGPwarn) likewise

2001-06-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * fixed smakefile: $< does NOT work, when there are 2 or more depencies
      in the header line! This only works, if the header files are never
      changed and this very unlikely.
    * Also adding $(CDEFS) before RESOPT was not that clever at all.
    * makeall.dos now uses the stuff Gunther introduced

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * makeall.ados: replaced "move" with "rename"
    * smakefile: changed CFLAGS handling, changed LINK statement
    * Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS: restructured
    * starter.c: cleanup

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

2001-06-20  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (Initialise) use iconfile as buffer for hideicon,
      move hidecion loading to an appropriate location
      (header) cleanup

2001-06-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * documented disabled warnings in smakefile, remove 2 disabled warnings
    * mada DATA=NEAR in smakefile, suggested by Gunther
    * added YAMOS-texts to other makefiles

2001-06-19  Giles Burdett <layabouts@the-giant-sofa.demon.co.uk>

    * Added #include <extra.h> to a number of files to stop "implicit declaration"
      warnings caused by usage of extra string functions
    * YAM now uses it's own icon when being hidden/iconified, instead of default
      icon provided by MUI

2001-06-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed potential enforcer hits where check for NULL of FO_GetCurrentFolder()
      was missing. Should also fix some enforcer hits on exit of YAM.

2001-06-18  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * YAM.c: (Terminate) always release resources in reverse allocation order
      (main) removed warning about return type and discarded STACKEXT
      (NOTE: STACKEXT doesn't do what was intended! It does *only* extend the
      stack if there is not enough space for the current frame. Thats hardly
      the case for main() ...)
    * YAM_FI.c: fix prototype for FI_IsFastSearch()
    * YAM_global.(c,h): replaced "APTR" with "void *" and removed include
    * YAM_UT.c: (DisplayAppIconStatistics) replaced AppAppIconA() with AddAppIcon()
      (DisplayStatistics) small cleanup

2001-06-18  Giles Burdett <layabouts@the-giant-sofa.demon.co.uk>

    * Added file dependencies listed in smakefile to Makefile, Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS and
      Makefile.m68k-AmigaOS-ixemul.
    * Added GNUC section to YAM_global.c to handle stack stuff - it is an empty section
      because GCC supports neither __stack nor __buffsize, but this empty define should
      really stay so that this fact is recorded instead of leading others to think that
      GCC support has not been considered.

2001-06-17  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * Moved __USE_SYSBASE from YAM_UT.c to smakefile (where it really belongs to).
    * Changed YAM_global.c stack stuff. This needs to be completed.
    * Made some more stuff static.
    * Moved last old.h stuff, old.h got obsolete now. First reordering step
      finished.
    * smakefile reflects the correct dependencies now. Please addapt this for
      other makefiles as well.

2001-06-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed "give up after 20 lines" signature strip "feature".
      (Bug #432034)

2001-06-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * the position of a folder was calculated wrong on performed FOLDERINFO rexx
      commands. fixed!
    * if using the folder context menu now, the mail list will be refreshed if
      the user uses the context menu on a folder that is not active. This will
      fix some bugs that will result because the mail list is not in sync with
      the folder list.
    * fixed several bugs concerning syncing of the mail and folder list.
      This also hopefully fixed now really (Bug #433825)

2001-06-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * C_c.sd: changed GetStripStr() to work with older versions of flexcat
    * YAM_CO.c: includes "extra.h" to get prototypes for non SAS/C
    * YAM_MA.c: fixed potential enforcer hits dueto FO_GetCurrentFolder() returning NULL
      (NOTE: There are more cases which need fixing!)
    * YAM_UT.c, YAM_WR.c: fixed warnings
    * YAM_WR.c: changed to enable optimizations for SAS/C
    * YAM_global.c: added additional processor checks for GCC and VBCC
    * YAM_rexx_rxcl.c: swapped include order of YAM_#?.h to get rid of warnings
    * extrasrc/dice.c: added popupmenu functions and cleanup
    * includes/extra.h: removed isascii define
    * YAM_WR.c: added isascii define

2001-06-16 Allan Odgaard <duff@diku.dk>

    * No longer sets MUIA_Window_Open to TRUE for main window on uniconify.
      (this had the effect of bringing main window to front on uniconify)
    * Added #define __USE_SYSBASE to YAM_UT.c so that it compiles with SAS/C.
    * Message list no longer has MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick set to TRUE
      since this makes it non-default when clicking outside the listview.
    * Now sets MUIA_BetterString_KeyUp/DownFocus for the To and Subject
      strings in the mail write window.
    * Updated BetterString_mcc.h (latest Betterstring.mcc can be found in the
      file area of YahooGroups.Com/yamos/).
    * When pressing ',' in the recipient string and text is marked, the comma
      will be inserted at the end of the string. This is to allow easier
      name-completion with multiple recipients.
    * Now sets GUI.NL_MAILS as the default object instead of GUI.LV_MAILS.
    * No longer sets the folder list as active window object when no entries
      exist in the message list (this would e.g. happen after sending emails
      from the outbox, because the outbox goes empty before returning to the
      inbox).
    * The OK gadget in the about window now have some space on each side of
      the label, bares the label 'Okay', is the default object and rendered in
      bold (to indicate the user can use 'return' to continue).
    * The OK gadget is now added after first phase of startup (rather than
      setting MUIA_ShowMe to TRUE) -- mainly because it's now 2 rectangle
      objects and the gadget, so we'd need to set the MUIA_ShowMe value for 3
      objects (not to mention that MUIA_ShowMe is buggy). Also
      MUIA_Window_Activate is set after this initial setup phase, so selecting
      about should now bring up an *active* about window.
    * Cancel is no longer the default gadget in the 'missing subject'-warning
      (since that'd make both the return and escape key act as cancel).

2001-06-16  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Re-added uniconify behaviour when attempting to start a second instance
      of YAM (without enforcer hits).
    * Corrected 'Check version' date.

2001-06-16  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * changed the behaviour of the WarnSubject requester due to some discussions
      in the YAMos ML.

2001-06-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * reactivated information bar, but made it optional. Now a user can select
      if he wants to have the infobar or not.
    * now the ContextMenus for the folder and message list are optional. A user can
      select in the configuration if he wants to have context menus or not.
      (Please note that if a context menu is selected and the user has the mouse
      over the list, the menu shortcuts will not work anymore due to a bug of MUI)
    * made WarnSubject a public option. The user can now select in the config if he
      wants to be warned or not if he is going to send a message without a subject.
    * fixed alignment bug in struct Rule.
    * Flush indices didn`t work on grouped folders - fixed. (Bug #433506)
    * Folder groups will be displayed highlighted&bold now if any child has new or
      unread mail.
    * if popupmenu.library is not present, the contextmenus are disabled completly
      now and it is possible to use the normal menu with shortcuts. Also the config
      items for the ContextMenu are disabled.
    * fixed recently introduced enforcer hits (Bug #433797)

2001-06-15  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed information bar, since it was redundant.

    * Removed error messages when unable to load images.

    * Last year digit was missing in error window - fixed! (Bug #431947)

2001-06-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed bug that caused that it was not possible to remove a entry from the folder
      listtree. (BUG #431912)
    * reworked addressbook search functions (AB_SearchEntry) completly. Now a search
      in the addressbook should perform faster. This will result in a faster
      name completion in AddressFields and if a mail is going to be sent out
    * fixed some addressbook<->NListtree related bugs/issues.
    * fixed Distribution List bug (BUG #431536)

2001-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed alignment Problem in "struct ComprMail" which causes the corruption of
      the old .index files from older 2.x versions. Now we should be compatible again.
    * merge the differences from RELEASE 2.3 branch to actual MAIN branch

2001-06-10  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * moved a lot more stuff to the corresponding header files
    * removed all includes from old.h
    * created YAM_global.h and YAM_global.o
    * made a lot of stuff static to YAM_RE.c, removed obsolete hook
    * changes smakefile to use $(CC) instead of slink

2001-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed folder shortcut keys "0-9" to have a fast jump to a folder.
      Folder groups are excluded here and will be overjumped. Also a folded tree will
      be unfolded if the user press a number where the tree was folded.
    * reworked and optimized some code in the addressbook code.
    * fixed addressbook entry selection bug. If a new mail was created and the user
      doubleclicked a entry in the addressbook to get the name in the addressfield
      YAM was not coping this address.
    * changed Library check routine to show the required revision also. Users where
      complaining about the NList.mcc v19.97 -> v19.98 upgrade requirement and the
      error message just showed "required v19".
    * fixed enforcer hit when creating a new folder in the listtree. -bug #431614

2001-06-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed addressbook NListtree bug where status_group image got trashed somehow.
    * now YAM doesn`t require the PROGDIR:Icons/* images anymore. This "feature" was
      added accidently and now it should only print a warning message to the
      Errorwindow of YAM.

2001-06-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * v18.7 of NListtree.mcc is now required because all earlier version seems to be too
      buggy to allow them.
    * The alternative images of the OUTGOING and DELETED folder will now be displayed if
      there is any mail in the folders. This is a more natural behaviour.
    * now the SortFlag of the NList Mail List should work again without flickering the
      Listview.
    * removed "Flush indices" entry of the FolderList ContextMenu

2001-06-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * 'Folder/Check single account' menu is no longer trashed after
      clicking 'Use' in the configuration window. (Bug #425212).

2001-06-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added next version of the folder_xxxx images to CVS
    * included the new folder_xxxx images in the code. Now also alternative images
      for INCOMING/OUTGOING and DELETED show be loaded and if there is new mail in the
      folder the image should change accordingly.
    * added a nice FolderInfoBar above the Listviews. Perhaps we have to make this
      bar optional, but I think it will fit in the layout if we are going to
      introduce TearOff.mcc in YAM.
    * changed FolderInfoBar refreshing. Now it should not flicker anymore and refreshing
      the main NList Mail List should be fast again.

2001-06-04  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * checked memory allocation&freeing of the folder listtree and it`s mails. Now it
      seems that all works fine.
    * reactivated the CompareHook for the folder listtree. Here we still have to do
      some modifications.

2001-06-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed recently introduced enforcerhit in the parsing of content-disposition
      parts
    * fixed LoadBCImage function where something went wrong with the stcpfn()
      function
    * added folder images from Philip A. Vedovatti to std images.

2001-06-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added support to load standard images for the standard INCOMING/OUTGOING/SENT
      and DELETED folder. The images must have the name "folder_incoming" a.s.o.
      at the PROGDIR:Icons/ directory to get loaded.
    * fixed alternative folder image function. This feature was broken and if you
      placed an image in the folder directory ".fimage" to was loaded incorrect.
      This should work now and if you have such an image file placed in the folder
      directory it will override the standard image that is loaded by YAM.
    * added a separate Error-Requester to screem out that an standard image file
      couldn`t be loaded.
    * added separate "supportfiles/Icons/std" directory at the cvs to place all the
      standard images+icons that should be included in the main YAM archive.

2001-06-01  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * created YAM_debug.h with stuff taken from old.h/YAM.h
    * YAM_FO.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c: use "YAM_debug.h"
    * YAM_UT.c: lame fix for a MUI header problem with GCC
    * YAM_md5.c: removed non-breaking spaces

2001-05-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * replaced MD5 calculation by PD variant

2001-05-27  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * moved a lot more stuff to the corresponding header files
    * NOTE: YAM_UT.c should be splitted!
    * Maybe the global variables from YAM.c should move into new file YAM_global.c?

2001-05-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed BUG #407550. Had to insert a InputBuffered at start to assure that G-TR
      gets cleared or otherwise it will be became NULL later which caused that
      mass of hits reported in the BugTracker.
    * a CTRL-C will now break the application and a CTRL-D will restart it immediatly.

2001-05-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added option to define the AppIcon Label that should be displayed. Now a
      User can configurate the string that should be displayed below the AppIcon
      by reconfigurating it in the configuration window (Misc)
    * YAM reads the Content-Disposition: of a multipart message now. If a name of
      a part could not be found in the Content-Type: field we get it from the
      Disposition field now. (i.e. mails with attachments from ELM behave like this)
      [ this fixes the reported bug #285 from Holger J.]
    * fixed today introduced bug. Now the AppIcon Label text gets saved & loaded
      correctly
    * a user can now select all folders that should be included in the AppIcon
      statistics. With that feature displaying statistics is not limited to the
      INCOMING folder anymore.

2001-05-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * variable signatures will now also be used if one want`s to write a NEW or
      FORWARD a mail in a folder which belongs to a mailinglist.
    * the format of the sizes can be choosen now. That means that one can choose
      between different display formats for displaying the message & attachment
      sizes in YAM. I added 4 more different size formats that will hopefully
      fit everyones needs. Default is the standard YAM size format which was there
      since ages.
    * added forgotten Help messages for the SMTP AUTH feature of YAM.
    * fixed bug in the alignment of POP3 struct. The listview of the POP3 accounts
      didn`t show up the accounts anymore. Perhaps here we have to use a separate
      displayhook if this realignment causes trouble with MorphOS.

2001-05-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * converted _WBenchMsg to WBmsg initialised from argv
    * YAM_CO.c: removed PL_IconBody[]
    * YAM_CL.c: added here
    * YAM_UT.c: replaced stch_i() with sscanf()
    * all_gcc.c: removed usage of stch_i

2001-05-22  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Enforcer Hit when searching by status (Bug #423880)

2001-05-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * put back all fold/unfold statements (///) for our beloved GoldED users :)
      This will break Dirks plan to remove all "//" comments, but I think that`s
      acceptable. ;)

2001-05-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * further reorganization
    * made whole code optimizable with SAS-C again (tracking down compiler bugs
      seems to get a hobby of me :-)
    * YAM_FO.c and YAM_EA.c are directly compilable now.

2001-05-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * some more stuff. Now at least the files
      YAM_ER.c, YAM_DI.c, YAM_US.c and YAM_md5.c compile without old.h
    * And modifications I do during cleanup:
    * remove clear and bzero, replace them by memset
    * remove stccpy and replace it by MyStrCpy (which is an easy define)
    * changed all "struct Object *" to "Object *"
    * Start using enum types wherever necessary. This will improve error checking.
      All enums get names now and these are used in structures and prototypes.
    * I also started to remove the // comments and replace them by /*** xxx ***/
      or /* xxx */. I hope everyone else will do this also at code-parts he works
      on, so they will disappear very soon.
    * All structure definitions get resorted and most important all elements get
      seperate lines and type entries (Looks much better).
    * Moved all library bases to YAM.c and made them all global. No other
      declarations elsewhere (Maybe we should move these declarations to
      YAM_globals.c as Gunther suggested).

2001-05-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started second step of cleanup
    * replaced compiler.h by SDI_compiler.h (please don't mind Gunther, but it is
      better structured and also reflects you original design better (e.g. ASM))
    * added HOOKPROTO in YAM_hook.h and started to use it everwhere. SDI_compiler.h
      is thus nearly used from YAM_hook.h only (HOOKPROTO taken from freeciv).
    * gen_gates will no longer work, but I think this can be replaced by the
      HOOKPROTO definitions directly.
    * moved wbpath.c into YAM_UT.h
    * the header files are still not complete, but much more :-)
    * compiling with SAS will get faster again, when old.h is away. Maybe also the
      optimizing problem will disappear then?

2001-05-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started first step of real code cleanup (very likely MorphOS support will
      be broken for some time!)
    * gen_includes.pl will be obsoleted by proper structures. If alignment cannot
      be reached by rearranging the stuff, pad bytes maybe added.
    * added lots of header files, added 2 new directories, moved files
    * Later necessary renames (when BETA is rejoined):
      YAM_DI.c --> YAM_glossarydisplay.c
      YAM_WR.c --> YAM_write.c
      YAM_FO.c --> YAM_folderconfig.c
      YAM_MA.c --> YAM_main.c
      YAM_FI.c --> YAM_find.c
      YAM_MI.c --> YAM_mime.c
      YAM_US.c --> YAM_userlist.c
      YAM_AB.c --> YAM_addressbook.c
      YAM_RE.c --> YAM_read.c
      YAM_MAf.c--> YAM_mainFolder.c
      YAM_CO.c --> YAM_config.c
      YAM_TR.c --> YAM_transfer.c
      YAM_COs.c--> YAM_configFile.c
      YAM_COg.c--> YAM_configGUI.c
      YAM_CL.c --> YAM_classes.c
      YAM_UT.c --> YAM_utilities.c
      YAM_ER.c --> YAM_error.c
      YAM_EA.c --> YAM_addressbookEntry.c
    * The old.h files replaces the YAM.h and headers.h and should disappear very
      soon. The includes have to be in the source codes directly and the definitions
      have to be in the related header files.
    * Only really required stuff should be moved there, so we can see obsoleted
      code after this is finished.
    * A BIG SORRY FOR THE PROBLEMS THIS MAY CAUSE, BUT IT WILL BE WORTH THE EFFORT!
    * added supportfiles directory and locale directory, the make process for locales
      should be moved to locale/makefile
    * also still undone, but the makefiles should be joined in major parts!
    * NOTE: The makefiles are to be reworked totally, especially the dependencies

2001-05-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added separate ContextMenus for the Folder Listtree and the Mail Listview.
      If popupmenu.library v9 or above could be found in the system a right
      mouseclick on the folder listtree or mail listview should pop up a nice
      ContextMenu now.

    * Fixed bug in the AB_FindTodaysBirthdates() function. Now YAM should find
      contacts who have birthday again.

    * Modified & reactivated AB_LB_CmpFunc() again. Now the addressbook should be
      sortable again.

2001-05-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added hierarchical folder support. Now it is possible to sort the mail folders
      via a listtree and to have folder groups.
      This feature will obsolete the folder SEPARATORs. The .folders config file format
      should stay compatible.

    * It is now possible to display a 16x16 image in front of every folder. The
      image file have to have the name ".fimage" and have to be located in
      the desired folder.
      NOTE: This feature is not finished 100% and has some bug I couldn`t resolve
      yet. -> Help wanted

    * some global optimizations on the folder listtree & mail listview.

2001-05-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added two hidden configuration items:
      - AskJumpUnread: if set to 'N', YAM will not suggest to jump to the
        next folder with unread mails.
      - WarnSubject: if set to 'N', YAM will not display the empty
        subject line warning.
      Both defaults to 'Y'.

2001-05-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Fixed Y2K bug in DateStamp2String() function. Now Daterequests to
      UNIXTIME should perform accurate. -> fixes the export email function

    * Removed some unneeded GetLocale calls for getting the TimeZone.
      Getting the actual TimeZone is only needed once YAM is started. This
      changes should also improved the MailListview a little bit because
      The DisplayHook was calling such GetLocale calls everytime.

2001-05-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Reverted back from NFloattext.mcc to Floattext.mcc in about window

    * If you enter an alias in a address field and press return the alias
      or realname will be resolved and the complete e-mail address string
      will be printed in the field now.

    * Added eMail resolving to the address field functions so that also
      while entering a eMail address YAM will try to resolve it from the
      addressbook. The resolve & expand ording will be
      Alias->RealName->eMail.

    * Fixed mailing list stuff again. Now Shift/Alt-Reply should behave
      like before.

2001-05-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Did some cosmetic changes to the About window

    * Modified Copyright string in About window and also in every source
      file

    * NListview & NList.mcc will be used now in the Attachment part of
      the write window

    * Added Title to the window that lists each part of a message.

    * Fixed behaviour of Mailing List feature for every folder. Now the
      correct From/To etc. should be set if To: Pattern is used

    * Added Signature selection to Mailinglist feature. Now you can select
      a different signature for every mailing list.

2001-05-06  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added backwards search to the 'change to next folder with unread
      mail' feature.

    * MA_ChangeFolder() now jumps to the first unread mail from bottom
      if reverse sorting is used in one of the sort criteria.
      This is needed for the above feature.

2001-05-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when trying to spawn a second instance of YAM
      while the first one is starting up.

2001-04-30  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a nasty crash bug when loading corrupted indices.  Left some
      debug info in there, since I lost the corrupted index during the
      tests.

2001-04-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed obsolete MCC NListtree check in addressbook code

2001-04-26  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added correct MCC version check.
    * Library open errors will now always be displayed in a requester,
      no matter if MUI is available. If possible, localized.

2001-04-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced Listtree.mcc with NListtree.mcc of Carsten Scholling
    * fixed some minor bugs in the addressbook code
    * added CVS $id tags to every source file for better revision control
    * changed AppIcon to also show the unread messages of the INCOMING
      folder (this is a feature I was searching for a long time :)
    * did some small cosmetic changes to the code


2001-04-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Nicer compilation date in About window ("7.4.2001" -> "07-Apr-01").

2001-04-02  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using Locale timezone setting now if available.

2001-03-21  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Offers to save the address book on quit if it was modified

    * Added some return statements to avoid warnings

2001-03-20  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed enforcer hits when listing a PGP keyring with very long UID
      lines.

2001-03-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When the maileditor is invoked from a readwindow this is updated
      after editing.

2001-03-17  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added rather rudimentary LaTeX printing support

2001-03-13  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added a warning when a mail without subject is going to be sent.

2001-03-10  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Changes for GCC/ixemul.

    * Workaround for the 'crash on editwindow close' bug added
      (YAM_UT.c/DisposeModule()).

2001-03-10  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Changed dynamic string functions in YAM_UT.c to use calloc()/free()
      instead of AllocMem()/FreeMem() and thus (hopefully) memory pools.

2001-03-08  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: potential NULL pointer referenced in StrBufCat() and
      StrBufCpy()

    * Started to improve the printing system (see RE_PrintFile())

2001-03-07  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: CheckPrinter() assumed printer on parallel port when
      interpreting printer.device status bits

2001-03-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Changed compiler options to avoid linker warning.

    * Changed default CPU target in SAS/C makefile to 68020.

2001-02-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When pressing "shift right" in the read window YAM now looks
      if there are unread mails in folders after the current one
      (below the current one in the folders list).
      If there are such folders the user is asked if he wants to change
      to the first of these and continue reading there.

2001-02-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed memory deallocation of all mails on shutdown when
      compiling with SAS/C - based on the assumption that SAS/C uses
      memory pools in its malloc()/free() implementation.

2001-02-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added TYPE/N (internal format) to the STEM that ARexx command
      FOLDERINFO returns:
      0 = normal
      1 = incoming
      2 = outgoing
      3 = sent (built-in)
      4 = deleted
      5 = sent and received
      6 = sent
      Useful for ARexx scripts when deciding whether to show the "From:"
      or "To:" header line.

    * Fixed wbstart-crash, which was introduced with the removal of
      the library auto-open (on January 28th).

2001-02-15 msbethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added external quote function to edit window (+preferences)

2001-02-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Address Book/New/Portrait/Select: The ASL requester title was
      "Se_lect" (same string used twice) - fixed! (Bug #131008).

2001-02-04  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed broken ARexx interface for SAS/C (introduced on January
      28th).

2001-02-04  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Utility and LocalBase types, added m68k-AmigaOS makefile
      and some other minor changes to be able to compile with GCC again.
      SAS/C users with old, broken includes have to fix them now.

2001-02-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when encountering message headers with
      non-terminated MIME-encoded text (i.e. during a folder rescan).

2001-01-29  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added dynamic date string creation in smakefile.

2001-01-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@amigaworld.com>

    * Moved SAS-C make process completely into smakefile

    * Now uses original Listtree includes

2000-12-21  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.

    * YAM would try to send mails using SMTP AUTH when a username was
      configured, even though "Use SMTP AUTH" wasn't selected. Fixed.
      Localized ESMTP error message.

2000-12-20  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

2000-12-20  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

2000-12-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

2000-12-18  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

2000-12-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

2000-12-10  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

2000-12-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

2000-12-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

2000-11-22  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added partial PGP multipart support
