    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

2000-12-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

2000-12-10  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

2000-12-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

2000-12-18  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

2000-12-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

2000-12-20  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

2000-12-20  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

2000-12-21  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.

    * YAM would try to send mails using SMTP AUTH when a username was
      configured, even though "Use SMTP AUTH" wasn't selected. Fixed.
      Localized ESMTP error message.

2001-01-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@amigaworld.com>

    * Moved SAS-C make process completely into smakefile

    * Now uses original Listtree includes

2001-01-29  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added dynamic date string creation in smakefile.

2001-02-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when encountering message headers with
      non-terminated MIME-encoded text (i.e. during a folder rescan).

2001-02-04  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Utility and LocalBase types, added m68k-AmigaOS makefile
      and some other minor changes to be able to compile with GCC again.
      SAS/C users with old, broken includes have to fix them now.

2001-02-04  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed broken ARexx interface for SAS/C (introduced on January
      28th).

2001-02-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Address Book/New/Portrait/Select: The ASL requester title was
      "Se_lect" (same string used twice) - fixed! (Bug #131008).

2001-02-15 msbethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added external quote function to edit window (+preferences)

2001-02-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added TYPE/N (internal format) to the STEM that ARexx command
      FOLDERINFO returns:
      0 = normal
      1 = incoming
      2 = outgoing
      3 = sent (built-in)
      4 = deleted
      5 = sent and received
      6 = sent
      Useful for ARexx scripts when deciding whether to show the "From:"
      or "To:" header line.

    * Fixed wbstart-crash, which was introduced with the removal of
      the library auto-open (on January 28th).

2001-02-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed memory deallocation of all mails on shutdown when
      compiling with SAS/C - based on the assumption that SAS/C uses
      memory pools in its malloc()/free() implementation.

2001-02-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When pressing "shift right" in the read window YAM now looks
      if there are unread mails in folders after the current one
      (below the current one in the folders list).
      If there are such folders the user is asked if he wants to change
      to the first of these and continue reading there.

2001-03-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Changed compiler options to avoid linker warning.

    * Changed default CPU target in SAS/C makefile to 68020.

2001-03-07  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: CheckPrinter() assumed printer on parallel port when
      interpreting printer.device status bits

2001-03-08  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: potential NULL pointer referenced in StrBufCat() and
      StrBufCpy()

    * Started to improve the printing system (see RE_PrintFile())
