2000-11-22  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added partial PGP multipart support

2000-12-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

2000-12-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

2000-12-10  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

2000-12-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

2000-12-18  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

2000-12-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

2000-12-20  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

2000-12-20  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

2000-12-21  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.

    * YAM would try to send mails using SMTP AUTH when a username was
      configured, even though "Use SMTP AUTH" wasn't selected. Fixed.
      Localized ESMTP error message.

2001-01-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@amigaworld.com>

    * Moved SAS-C make process completely into smakefile

    * Now uses original Listtree includes

2001-01-29  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added dynamic date string creation in smakefile.

2001-02-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when encountering message headers with
      non-terminated MIME-encoded text (i.e. during a folder rescan).

2001-02-04  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Utility and LocalBase types, added m68k-AmigaOS makefile
      and some other minor changes to be able to compile with GCC again.
      SAS/C users with old, broken includes have to fix them now.

2001-02-04  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed broken ARexx interface for SAS/C (introduced on January
      28th).

2001-02-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Address Book/New/Portrait/Select: The ASL requester title was
      "Se_lect" (same string used twice) - fixed! (Bug #131008).

2001-02-15 msbethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added external quote function to edit window (+preferences)

2001-02-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added TYPE/N (internal format) to the STEM that ARexx command
      FOLDERINFO returns:
      0 = normal
      1 = incoming
      2 = outgoing
      3 = sent (built-in)
      4 = deleted
      5 = sent and received
      6 = sent
      Useful for ARexx scripts when deciding whether to show the "From:"
      or "To:" header line.

    * Fixed wbstart-crash, which was introduced with the removal of
      the library auto-open (on January 28th).

2001-02-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed memory deallocation of all mails on shutdown when
      compiling with SAS/C - based on the assumption that SAS/C uses
      memory pools in its malloc()/free() implementation.

2001-02-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When pressing "shift right" in the read window YAM now looks
      if there are unread mails in folders after the current one
      (below the current one in the folders list).
      If there are such folders the user is asked if he wants to change
      to the first of these and continue reading there.

2001-03-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Changed compiler options to avoid linker warning.

    * Changed default CPU target in SAS/C makefile to 68020.

2001-03-07  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: CheckPrinter() assumed printer on parallel port when
      interpreting printer.device status bits

2001-03-08  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: potential NULL pointer referenced in StrBufCat() and
      StrBufCpy()

    * Started to improve the printing system (see RE_PrintFile())

2001-03-10  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Changed dynamic string functions in YAM_UT.c to use calloc()/free()
      instead of AllocMem()/FreeMem() and thus (hopefully) memory pools.

2001-03-10  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Changes for GCC/ixemul.

    * Workaround for the 'crash on editwindow close' bug added
      (YAM_UT.c/DisposeModule()).

2001-03-13  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added a warning when a mail without subject is going to be sent.

2001-03-17  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added rather rudimentary LaTeX printing support

2001-03-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When the maileditor is invoked from a readwindow this is updated
      after editing.

2001-03-20  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed enforcer hits when listing a PGP keyring with very long UID
      lines.

2001-03-21  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Offers to save the address book on quit if it was modified

    * Added some return statements to avoid warnings

2001-04-02  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using Locale timezone setting now if available.

2001-04-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Nicer compilation date in About window ("7.4.2001" -> "07-Apr-01").

2001-04-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced Listtree.mcc with NListtree.mcc of Carsten Scholling
    * fixed some minor bugs in the addressbook code
    * added CVS $id tags to every source file for better revision control
    * changed AppIcon to also show the unread messages of the INCOMING folder
      (this is a feature I was searching for a long time :)
    * did some small cosmetic changes to the code

2001-04-26  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added correct MCC version check.
    * Library open errors will now always be displayed in a requester,
      no matter if MUI is available. If possible, localized.

2001-04-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed obsolete MCC NListtree check in addressbook code

2001-04-30  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a nasty crash bug when loading corrupted indices.  Left some
      debug info in there, since I lost the corrupted index during the
      tests.

2001-05-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when trying to spawn a second instance of YAM
      while the first one is starting up.

2001-05-06  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added backwards search to the 'change to next folder with unread
      mail' feature.

    * MA_ChangeFolder() now jumps to the first unread mail from bottom
      if reverse sorting is used in one of the sort criteria.
      This is needed for the above feature.

2001-05-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Did some cosmetic changes to the About window

    * Modified Copyright string in About window and also in every source
      file

    * NListview & NList.mcc will be used now in the Attachment part of
      the write window

    * Added Title to the window that lists each part of a message.

    * Fixed behaviour of Mailing List feature for every folder. Now the
      correct From/To etc. should be set if To: Pattern is used

    * Added Signature selection to Mailinglist feature. Now you can select
      a different signature for every mailing list.

2001-05-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Reverted back from NFloattext.mcc to Floattext.mcc in about window

    * If you enter an alias in a address field and press return the alias or
      realname will be resolved and the complete e-mail address string will
      be printed in the field now.

    * Added eMail resolving to the address field functions so that also while
      entering a eMail address YAM will try to resolve it from the addressbook.
      The resolve & expand ording will be Alias->RealName->eMail.

    * Fixed mailing list stuff again. Now Shift/Alt-Reply should behave like
      before.

2001-05-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Fixed Y2K bug in DateStamp2String() function. Now Daterequests to UNIXTIME
      should perform accurate. -> fixes the export email function

    * Removed some unneeded GetLocale calls for getting the TimeZone. Getting the
      actual TimeZone is only needed once YAM is started. This changes should also
      improved the MailListview a little bit because The DisplayHook was calling
      such GetLocale calls everytime.

2001-05-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added hierarchical folder support. Now it is possible to sort the mail folders
      via a listtree and to have folder groups.
      This feature will obsolete the folder SEPARATORs. The .folders config file format
      should stay compatible.

    * It is now possible to display a 16x16 image in front of every folder. The
      image file have to have the name ".fimage" and have to be located in
      the desired folder.
      NOTE: This feature is not finished 100% and has some bug I couldn`t resolve
      yet. -> Help wanted

    * some global optimizations on the folder listtree & mail listview.

2001-05-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Added separate ContextMenus for the Folder Listtree and the Mail Listview.
      If popupmenu.library v9 or above could be found in the system a right
      mouseclick on the folder listtree or mail listview should pop up a nice
      ContextMenu now.

    * Fixed bug in the AB_FindTodaysBirthdates() function. Now YAM should find
      contacts who have birthday again.

    * Modified & reactivated AB_LB_CmpFunc() again. Now the addressbook should be
      sortable again.

2001-05-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started first step of real code cleanup (very likely MorphOS support will
      be broken for some time!)
    * gen_includes.pl will be obsoleted by proper structures. If alignment cannot
      be reached by rearranging the stuff, pad bytes maybe added.
    * added lots of header files, added 2 new directories, moved files
    * Later necessary renames (when BETA is rejoined):
      YAM_DI.c --> YAM_glossarydisplay.c
      YAM_WR.c --> YAM_write.c
      YAM_FO.c --> YAM_folderconfig.c
      YAM_MA.c --> YAM_main.c
      YAM_FI.c --> YAM_find.c
      YAM_MI.c --> YAM_mime.c
      YAM_US.c --> YAM_userlist.c
      YAM_AB.c --> YAM_addressbook.c
      YAM_RE.c --> YAM_read.c
      YAM_MAf.c--> YAM_mainFolder.c
      YAM_CO.c --> YAM_config.c
      YAM_TR.c --> YAM_transfer.c
      YAM_COs.c--> YAM_configFile.c
      YAM_COg.c--> YAM_configGUI.c
      YAM_CL.c --> YAM_classes.c
      YAM_UT.c --> YAM_utilities.c
      YAM_ER.c --> YAM_error.c
      YAM_EA.c --> YAM_addressbookEntry.c
    * The old.h files replaces the YAM.h and headers.h and should disappear very
      soon. The includes have to be in the source codes directly and the definitions
      have to be in the related header files.
    * Only really required stuff should be moved there, so we can see obsoleted
      code after this is finished.
    * A BIG SORRY FOR THE PROBLEMS THIS MAY CAUSE, BUT IT WILL BE WORTH THE EFFORT!
    * added supportfiles directory and locale directory, the make process for locales
      should be moved to locale/makefile
    * also still undone, but the makefiles should be joined in major parts!
    * NOTE: The makefiles are to be reworked totally, especially the dependencies

2001-05-19  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * started second step of cleanup
    * replaced compiler.h by SDI_compiler.h (please don't mind Gunther, but it is
      better structured and also reflects you original design better (e.g. ASM))
    * added HOOKPROTO in YAM_hook.h and started to use it everwhere. SDI_compiler.h
      is thus nearly used from YAM_hook.h only (HOOKPROTO taken from freeciv).
    * gen_gates will no longer work, but I think this can be replaced by the
      HOOKPROTO definitions directly.
    * moved wbpath.c into YAM_UT.h
    * the header files are still not complete, but much more :-)
    * compiling with SAS will get faster gaian, when old.h is away. Maybe also the
      optimizing problem will disappear then?

2001-05-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * some more stuff. Now at least the files
      YAM_ER.c, YAM_DI.c, YAM_US.c and YAM_md5.c compile without old.h
    * And modifications I do during cleanup:
    * remove clear and bzero, replace them by memset
    * remove stccpy and replace it by MyStrCpy (which is an easy define)
    * changed all "struct Object *" to "Object *"
    * Start using enum types wherever necessary. This will improve error checking.
      All enums get names now and these are used in structures and prototypes.
    * I also started to remove the // comments and replace them by /*** xxx ***/
      or /* xxx */. I hope everyone else will do this also at code-parts he works
      on, so they will disappear very soon.
    * All structure definitions get resorted and most important all elements get
      seperate lines and type entries (Looks much better).
    * Moved all library bases to YAM.c and made them all global. No other
      declarations elsewhere (Maybe we should move these declarations to
      YAM_globals.c as Gunther suggested).

2001-05-20  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * further reorganization
    * made whole code optimizable with SAS-C again (tracking down compiler bugs
      seems to get a hobby of me :-)
    * YAM_FO.c and YAM_EA.c are directly compilable now.

2001-05-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * put back all fold/unfold statements (///) for our beloved GoldED users :)
      This will break Dirks plan to remove all "//" comments, but I think that`s
      acceptable. ;)

2001-05-22  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * converted _WBenchMsg to WBmsg initialised from argv
    * YAM_CO.c: removed PL_IconBody[]
    * YAM_CL.c: added here
    * YAM_UT.c: replaced stch_i() with sscanf()
    * all_gcc.c: removed usage of stch_i

2001-05-22  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * variable signatures will now also be used if one want`s to write a NEW or
      FORWARD a mail in a folder which belongs to a mailinglist.
    * the format of the sizes can be choosen now. That means that one can choose
      between different display formats for displaying the message & attachment
      sizes in YAM. I added 4 more different size formats that will hopefully
      fit everyones needs. Default is the standard YAM size format which was there
      since ages.
    * added forgotten Help messages for the SMTP AUTH feature of YAM.
    * fixed bug in the alignment of POP3 struct. The listview of the POP3 accounts
      didn`t show up the accounts anymore. Perhaps here we have to use a separate
      displayhook if this realignment causes trouble with MorphOS.

2001-05-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added option to define the AppIcon Label that should be displayed. Now a
      User can configurate the string that should be displayed below the AppIcon
      by reconfigurating it in the configuration window (Misc)
    * YAM reads the Content-Disposition: of a multipart message now. If a name of
      a part could not be found in the Content-Type: field we get it from the
      Disposition field now. (i.e. mails with attachments from ELM behave like this)
      [ this fixes the reported bug #285 from Holger J.]
    * fixed today introduced bug. Now the AppIcon Label text gets saved & loaded
      correctly
    * a user can now select all folders that should be included in the AppIcon
      statistics. With that feature displaying statistics is not limited to the
      INCOMING folder anymore.

2001-05-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed BUG #407550. Had to insert a InputBuffered at start to assure that G-TR
      gets cleared or otherwise it will be became NULL later which caused that
      mass of hits reported in the BugTracker.
    * a CTRL-C will now break the application and a CTRL-D will restart it immediatly.

2001-05-27  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * moved a lot more stuff to the corresponding header files
    * NOTE: YAM_UT.c should be splitted!
    * Maybe the global variables from YAM.c should move into new file YAM_global.c?

2001-05-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@epost.de>

    * replaced MD5 calculation by PD variant

2001-06-01  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

   * created YAM_debug.h with stuff taken from old.h/YAM.h
   * YAM_FO.c, YAM_MAf.c, YAM_RE.c: use "YAM_debug.h"
   * YAM_UT.c: lame fix for a MUI header problem with GCC
   * YAM_md5.c: removed non-breaking spaces

2001-06-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added support to load standard images for the standard INCOMING/OUTGOING/SENT
      and DELETED folder. The images must have the name "folder_incoming" a.s.o.
      at the PROGDIR:Icons/ directory to get loaded.
    * fixed alternative folder image function. This feature was broken and if you
      placed an image in the folder directory ".fimage" to was loaded incorrect.
      This should work now and if you have such an image file placed in the folder
      directory it will override the standard image that is loaded by YAM.
    * added a separate Error-Requester to screem out that an standard image file
      couldn`t be loaded.
    * added separate "supportfiles/Icons/std" directory at the cvs to place all the
      standard images+icons that should be included in the main YAM archive.

2001-06-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed recently introduced enforcerhit in the parsing of content-disposition
      parts
    * fixed LoadBCImage function where something went wrong with the stcpfn()
      function
    * added folder images from Philip A. Vedovatti to std images.
