2000-11-22  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added partial PGP multipart support

2000-12-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

2000-12-07  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

2000-12-10  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

2000-12-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

2000-12-18  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

2000-12-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

2000-12-20  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

2000-12-20  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

2000-12-21  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.

    * YAM would try to send mails using SMTP AUTH when a username was
      configured, even though "Use SMTP AUTH" wasn't selected. Fixed.
      Localized ESMTP error message.

2001-01-28  Dirk Stöcker <stoecker@amigaworld.com>

    * Moved SAS-C make process completely into smakefile

    * Now uses original Listtree includes

    * Added dynamic date string creation in smakefile.

2001-02-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when encountering message headers with
      non-terminated MIME-encoded text (i.e. during a folder rescan).

2001-02-04  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Utility and LocalBase types, added m68k-AmigaOS makefile
      and some other minor changes to be able to compile with GCC again.
      SAS/C users with old, broken includes have to fix them now.

2001-02-04  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed broken ARexx interface for SAS/C (introduced on January
      28th).

2001-02-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Address Book/New/Portrait/Select: The ASL requester title was
      "Se_lect" (same string used twice) - fixed! (Bug #131008).

2001-02-15 msbethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Added external quote function to edit window (+preferences)

2001-02-17  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added TYPE/N (internal format) to the STEM that ARexx command
      FOLDERINFO returns:
      0 = normal
      1 = incoming
      2 = outgoing
      3 = sent (built-in)
      4 = deleted
      5 = sent and received
      6 = sent
      Useful for ARexx scripts when deciding whether to show the "From:"
      or "To:" header line.

    * Fixed wbstart-crash, which was introduced with the removal of
      the library auto-open (on January 28th).

2001-02-19  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed memory deallocation of all mails on shutdown when
      compiling with SAS/C - based on the assumption that SAS/C uses
      memory pools in its malloc()/free() implementation.

2001-02-19  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * When pressing "shift right" in the read window YAM now looks
      if there are unread mails in folders after the current one
      (below the current one in the folders list).
      If there are such folders the user is asked if he wants to change
      to the first of these and continue reading there.

2001-03-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Changed compiler options to avoid linker warning.

      interpreting printer.device status bits

2001-03-08  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Fixed: potential NULL pointer referenced in StrBufCat() and
      StrBufCpy()

    * Started to improve the printing system (see RE_PrintFile())

2001-03-10  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

    * Changed dynamic string functions in YAM_UT.c to use calloc()/free()
      instead of AllocMem()/FreeMem() and thus (hopefully) memory pools.

2001-03-10  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Changes for GCC/ixemul.

    * Workaround for the 'crash on editwindow close' bug added
      (YAM_UT.c/DisposeModule()).

2001-03-13  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added a warning when a mail without subject is going to be sent.

2001-03-17  Matthias Bethke <Matthias.Bethke@gmx.net>

2001-04-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * replaced Listtree.mcc with NListtree.mcc of Carsten Scholling
    * fixed some minor bugs in the addressbook code
    * added CVS $id tags to every source file for better revision control
    * changed AppIcon to also show the unread messages of the INCOMING
      folder (this is a feature I was searching for a long time :)
    * did some small cosmetic changes to the code

2001-04-26  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added correct MCC version check.
    * Library open errors will now always be displayed in a requester,
      no matter if MUI is available. If possible, localized.

2001-04-26  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * removed obsolete MCC NListtree check in addressbook code

2001-04-30  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a nasty crash bug when loading corrupted indices.  Left some
      debug info in there, since I lost the corrupted index during the
      tests.

2001-05-01  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when trying to spawn a second instance of YAM
      while the first one is starting up.

2001-05-06  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Added backwards search to the 'change to next folder with unread
      mail' feature.

    * MA_ChangeFolder() now jumps to the first unread mail from bottom
      if reverse sorting is used in one of the sort criteria.
      This is needed for the above feature.

2001-05-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Did some cosmetic changes to the About window

    * Modified Copyright string in About window and also in every source
      file

    * NListview & NList.mcc will be used now in the Attachment part of
      the write window

    * Added Title to the window that lists each part of a message.

    * Fixed behaviour of Mailing List feature for every folder. Now the
      correct From/To etc. should be set if To: Pattern is used

    * Added Signature selection to Mailinglist feature. Now you can select
      a different signature for every mailing list.

2001-05-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Reverted back from NFloattext.mcc to Floattext.mcc in about window

    * If you enter an alias in a address field and press return the alias
      or realname will be resolved and the complete e-mail address string
      will be printed in the field now.

    * Added eMail resolving to the address field functions so that also
      while entering a eMail address YAM will try to resolve it from the
      addressbook. The resolve & expand ording will be
      Alias->RealName->eMail.

    * Fixed mailing list stuff again. Now Shift/Alt-Reply should behave
      like before.

2001-05-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * Fixed Y2K bug in DateStamp2String() function. Now Daterequests to
      UNIXTIME should perform accurate. -> fixes the export email function

    * Removed some unneeded GetLocale calls for getting the TimeZone.
      Getting the actual TimeZone is only needed once YAM is started. This
      changes should also improved the MailListview a little bit because
      The DisplayHook was calling such GetLocale calls everytime.

2001-05-14  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added two hidden configuration items:
      - AskJumpUnread: if set to 'N', YAM will not suggest to jump to the
        next folder with unread mails.
      - WarnSubject: if set to 'N', YAM will not display the empty
        subject line warning.
      Both defaults to 'Y'.

    * Fixed Enforcer Hit when searching by status (Bug #423880)

2001-06-06  Jacob Laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * 'Folder/Check single account' menu is no longer trashed after
      clicking 'Use' in the configuration window. (Bug #425212).

    * Re-added uniconify behaviour when attempting to start a second instance
      of YAM (without enforcer hits).

    * Corrected 'Check version' date.

    * Better looking 'Okay' button in about window.

      Bug #433820; this was introduced in YAM_WR.c rev 1.28

2001-08-23  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: now recognizes attachment name in Content-Disposition
      header also (patch from MAIN)

2001-09-12  Christian Hattemer <krille@users.sourceforge.net>

    * YAM_RE.c: Now accepts "(" and ")" in URLs also
      (according to RFC 1738, ";" are also allowed in some cases
       but not yet added)
      Fixes Bug #460488
