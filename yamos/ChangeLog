    * Enforcer hits when doing: rx "address 'YAM';info"
      (without arguments) Fixed!

    * Added "From:" address to folder options. Useful when using
      different e-mail addresses on different mailing lists.

    * When deleting a bunch of mails, and one with Disposition
      Notification pops up - new option: Ignore all

2000-12-07  laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added "Reply-To:" address to folder options. Useful for folders that
      are mail aliases instead of real mailing lists, to avoid getting
      dublicate answers.

    * Removed custom bsdsocket.library interface - now uses the includes.

2000-12-17  laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * SAS/C fixes. Now compiles again, also without V44 includes.

    * Removed enforcer hits when creating new messages.

    * YAM.cd: Set max. length of commodity description to 39 characters.

    * Added sprintf() replacement with Locale support.

    * Using ARexx commands MAILWRITE and MAILSEND, while YAM is iconified
      and the external editor is configured to be spawned always, would
      throw enforcer hits. Fixed.

    * Got rid of the ANSI C time() function, which would access ENV:TZ
      each time a log entry or new mail was to be written.

    * Fixed .taglines bug - %'s was used for formatting, which would
      result in a "***NULL POINTER***" mess.

    * Localized all menu shortcuts in main window.

2000-12-20  laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Finished slave work on menus in main window.

    * Added "Fixed font" menu item in read window to quickly switch
      font when needed. It doesn't work yet, though, since TextEditor.mcc
      doesn't seem to catch MUIA_TextEditor_FixedFont on the fly.

    * Now explicitly opens utility.library.

    * Added SMTP AUTH to config GUI.

2000-12-21  laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Fixed a very nasty bug when using the ARexx command MAILWRITE with
      the QUIET switch.

    * YAM would try to send mails using SMTP AUTH when a username was
      configured, even though "Use SMTP AUTH" wasn't selected. Fixed.
      Localized ESMTP error message.

    * Moved SAS-C make process completely into smakefile

    * Now uses original Listtree includes

2001-01-29  laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added dynamic date string creation in smakefile.

2001-02-01  laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Removed enforcer hits when encountering message headers with
      non-terminated MIME-encoded text (i.e. during a folder rescan).

2001-02-04  Jörg Strohmayer <joergs@users.sourceforge.net>

    * Fixed Utility and LocalBase types, added m68k-AmigaOS makefile
      and some other minor changes to be able to compile with GCC again.
      SAS/C users with old, broken includes have to fix them now.

2001-02-17  laursen <laursen@myself.com>

    * Added TYPE/N (internal format) to the STEM that ARexx command
      FOLDERINFO returns:
      0 = normal
      1 = incoming
      2 = outgoing
      3 = sent (built-in)
      4 = deleted
      5 = sent and received
      6 = sent
      Useful for ARexx scripts when deciding whether to show the "From:"
      or "To:" header line.

    * Fixed wbstart-crash, which was introduced with the removal of
      the library auto-open.
