                     YAM 2.4 - Installation notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To minimize download time, YAM 2.4 is distributed in four different LhA
archives which must be unpacked into the same directory before installation.

YAM24.lha        YAM 2.4 basic installation for 68020 processors or better,
                 includes English manual
YAM24cpu.lha     Executables optimized for 68040 and 68060 processors
YAM24loc.lha     Foreign language support (catalogs and manuals)
YAM24con.lha     Additional graphics, ARexx scripts, etc.


YAM 1.3.x users
---------------
Before you start the installation script, it's strongly recommended that
you create a backup of the old YAM directory including all folders and
configuration files. Now you should install YAM 2.4 into your old YAM
directory. YAM 2.4 will automatically convert configuration files from
YAM 1.3.x into the new 2.x format.

- Fixed: no more Enforcer hits on exit (damato)
- Fixed: YAM didn't really disconnect from the server if an STMP AUTH
  request failed (damato)
- Fixed: the response gotten from the server was never reported to the
  user if SMTP AUTH failed (damato)
- Fixed: if a host had 2 different IPs in the DNS and the first one
  was down, YAM would never try to connect to the second one and just
  threw an error message (damato)
- Fixed: aborting a mail transfer could throw Enforcer hits; we didn't
  even issue a QUIT command (damato)
- Fixed: YAM could crash if the Edit window was opened from a Read window
  and the Read window was closed before clicking Send now/Send later/Hold
  (krille)
- Fixed: YAM could get confused while re-selecting multiple parts of a
  message (damato)
- Fixed: the appearance of the message status flags could get corrupted
  because of a too wide Address column (damato)
- Fixed: at long last, sorting by status works as it should (damato)
- Fixed: updating the folder index didn't clear the mail listview, thus
  letting the user toy around with the list and break havoc (damato)
- Fixed: several problems with the handling of temporary files, using
  now an additional serial ID and a smarter access mechanism (damato)
- Fixed: several problems with trying to open an inexistant mail file,
  returning now a proper error message (damato)
- Fixed: an error on sending could make sent email to end up in the
  wrong folder (damato)
- Fixed: potential crash in the message handling because YAM forgot to
  close the output file on an error condition (damato)
- Fixed: temporary unpack files (XPK) weren't deleted when switching
  messages from within the Read window (damato)
- Fixed: temporary unpack files were deleted too early, making it
  impossible to e.g. display raw messages in compressed folders
  (damato)
- Fixed: the gauge in the mail transfer window would never reach 100%
  (damato)
- Fixed: enforced proper Write window parameters when dealing with ARexx
  to avoid things going terribly wrong (damato)
- Fixed: ADDRDELETE would throw Enforcer hits if no alias was provided
  (damato)
- Fixed: ADDREDIT couldn't edit/create distribution lists without
  throwing Enforcer hits later (damato)
- Fixed: ADDRRESOLVE was utterly broken and crashed the system right
  away (damato)
- Fixed: GETSELECTED wouldn't initialize <stem>num.count in empty folders
  (damato)
- Fixed: INFO SCREEN would return an empty string if YAM was iconified
  (damato)
- Fixed: MAILREAD couldn't really activate a Read window (damato)
- Fixed: MAILWRITE couldn't really activate a Write window (damato)
- Fixed: MAILWRITE accepted bad WINDOW values (damato)
- Fixed: Enforcer hits when filtering by message body or headers (damato)
- Fixed: remote filters could trigger actions that were not supposed to
  (damato)
- Fixed: Enforcer hits when clicking the [Filter] button or selecting
  the address to send the reply to (damato)
- Fixed: preselection didn't work at all if "Download new mail on startup"
  was enabled (damato)
- Fixed: no mail was downloaded automatically if "Download large messages"
  was disabled (damato)
- Fixed: it was possible to interrupt a mail transfer by using "Check
  version" (damato)
- Fixed: calling "Show last message" would disrupt the current mail transfer
  and cause further calamities later on (damato)
- Fixed: clicking the support URL <www.yam.ch> in the About window on
  startup was rewarded with an Enforcer hit (damato)
- Fixed: the results in the Search window could get out of sync with the
  message list (damato)
- Fixed: even if "Display all texts" was disabled, some operations in the
  Read window could still trigger text parts to be displayed entirely
  (damato)
- Fixed: "Next/Previous message in thread" would fail most of the time;
  replaced the rudimentary algorithm this code was based on with a more
  advanced CRC32 checksum algorithm which in turn calls for an .index
  revision update - yup, this *REQUIRES ALL INDICES TO BE UPDATED*, but
  this also wins you the possibility of sorting messages by the date they
  were received or sent, which has now been implemented for real, complete
  with a suitable new "Date sent/received" sort criterion
- Fixed: a gadget in the filter definition showed junk when switching
  to a remote filter and viceversa (damato)
- Fixed: YAM remembers again the last active message in a folder and jumps
  to this message if the folder is selected again (damato)
- Fixed: doesn't lose track anymore when Next/Previous message is selected
  in the Read window and an unrelated folder is currently opened (damato)
- Fixed: the address book listview won't be cleared anymore if YAM can't
  open a new address book from disk (damato)
- Fixed: variable signatures will also work now when forwarding or
  writing a new mail in a folder belonging to a mailing list (damato)
- Fixed: the title of the file requester for importing MIME viewers & types
  was not localized (damato)
- Fixed: the [Okay] button in the About window got lost on restart (damato)
- Fixed: the keyboard shortcut for "Security" in the address book works,
  now (krille)
- Fixed: double clicking mailto: links does something useful again; as
  an extra bonus, subject, CC and BCC fields are also correctly handled as
  in mailto:a@b.c?subject=test&amp;cc=b@c.d , and two URLs can appear in
  the same line without triggering side effects, hooray! :) (damato)
- Fixed: temporary files for attachments cancelled in the Write window
  were not deleted (damato)
- Fixed: couldn't display raw messages stored in PROGDIR:folder (damato)
- Fixed: will now take care of spaces in path names when calling MIME
  viewers (damato)
- Fixed: when dealing with subjects without a space after the [tag],
  i.e. "Re: [list]subject", YAM would delete the first character in the
  edited subject (charlie)
- Fixed: problem with the "%" character in attachment filenames (damato)
- Fixed: the "group for new entries" in the address book configuration
  was never used (damato)
- Fixed: two codes were used in the logfile for different purposes
  (tactica)
- Fixed: the duplicated "shift right" menu shortcut in the Read window
  is now gone (tactica)

- Changed: "Program startup" & "Program termination" macros are also
  executed on Restart (damato)
- Changed: windows are now navigable no matter what's the status of
  the Caps Lock key (damato)
- Changed: the POP3 and SMTP ports can now be specified in their own
  gadgets (damato)
- Changed: commas within double quotes are now accepted as valid
  characters in recipient string gadgets (laursen)
- Changed: if PGP is not found, it won't be used at all instead of
  putting up a "PGP signature key is not correct" warning every time
  (krille)
- Changed: dates in the mail listview and other areas are now displayed
  using Locale settings (damato)
- Changed: YAM will also honour the hidden JumpToNewMsg option regarding
  newly received messages (damato)
- Changed: the listview in the Search window will now be sorted by
  date by default (damato)
- Changed: personal sender info will only be displayed if only one
  matching Real Name is found in the address book (damato)
- Changed: removed the %h variable from the popup list for the Open and
  Close phrases, since it doesn't make much sense there (damato)
- Changed: string gadgets for email addresses and real names are now
  limited to 150 and 30 characters, respectively (damato)
- Changed: when sorting messages by status, additional flags will be
  taken into account, e.g. messages marked as "important" will be listed
  first (damato)
- Changed: trying to import email from a file that doesn't contain any
  will now trigger an error message (damato)
- Changed: updated the URLs given by the warning in MIME messages
  (tactica)
- Changed: email sending & automatic email downloads will also be notified
  in the status bar (damato)
- Changed: creating a new filter will now automatically select the Name
  string gadget (damato)
- Changed: trying to load an apparently invalid address book will now
  put up a requester offering the user to load the file as a line
  separated list of names and email addresses rather than blindly
  loading whatever is thrown at it (damato)
- Changed: made the GUI a bit less obstrusive at getting the focus
  while the user is typing away elsewhere (damato)
- Changed: "Show last message" remains ghosted now until there is actually
  some message to show (damato)
- Changed: sizes of uuencoded attachments are displayed with a "~" (tilde)
  character in the Read window meaning this is just an approximation
- Changed: email addresses in the usual a@b.c form are now clickable
  just like mailto: links, and they are shown highlighted just like URLs
- Changed: CTRL-C will now break the application, while CTRL-D will
  restart it immediately (damato)
- Changed: updated default remailer address (damato)
- Changed: now requires NList.mcc 20.104 and NListtree.mcc 18.12 as
  the bare minimum (damato)

  and nested at the user's discretion (damato)
- Added: SMTP & POP3 TLS1/SSL3 support for stunnel servers, using
  AmiSSL.library (damato)
