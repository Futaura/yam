                     YAM 2.4 - Installation notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To minimize download time, YAM 2.4 is distributed in five different LhA
archives which must be unpacked into the same directory before installation.

YAM24.lha        YAM 2.4 basic installation for 68020 processors or better,
                 includes English manual
YAM24cpu.lha     Diff for 68040 and 68060 processors
YAM24mos.lha     YAM 2.4 MorphOS executables for PPC support.
YAM24loc.lha     Foreign language support (catalogs and manuals)
YAM24con.lha     Additional graphics, ARexx scripts, etc.


YAM 1.3.x users
---------------
Before you start the installation script, it's strongly recommended that
you create a backup of the old YAM directory including all folders and
configuration files. Now you should install YAM 2.4 into your old YAM
directory. YAM 2.4 will automatically convert configuration files from
YAM 1.3.x into the new 2.x format.

- Fixed: no more Enforcer hits on exit (damato)
- Fixed: if SMTP AUTH failed, the response gotten from the server was
  never reported to the user, and the connection remained alive (damato)
- Fixed: if a host had 2 different IPs in the DNS and the first one
  was down, it would never try to connect to the second one and just
  threw an error message (damato)
- Fixed: aborting a mail transfer could throw Enforcer hits, and no
  QUIT command was sent (damato)
- Fixed: transmission of binary data containing NULL bytes could be
  mangled, typically when transmitting PDF documents (damato)
- Fixed: potential crash if the Edit window was opened from a Read window
  and the Read window was closed before clicking Send now/Send later/Hold
  (krille)
- Fixed: possible confusion while re-selecting multiple parts of a
  message (damato)
- Fixed: the appearance of the message status flags could get corrupted
  because of a too wide Address column (damato)
- Fixed: sorting by status works now as intended (damato)
- Fixed: updating the folder index didn't clear the mail listview, thus
  letting the user toy around with the list and break havoc (damato)
- Fixed: several problems with the handling of temporary files, using
  now an additional serial ID and a smarter access mechanism (damato)
- Fixed: several problems when trying to open an inexistant mail file,
  returning now a proper error message (damato)
- Fixed: an error on sending could make sent email to end up in the
  wrong folder (damato)
- Fixed: potential crash in the message handling because it forgot to
  close the output file on an error condition (damato)
- Fixed: temporary unpack files (XPK) weren't deleted when switching
  messages from within the Read window (damato)
- Fixed: temporary unpack files were deleted too early, making it
  impossible to e.g. display raw messages in compressed folders
  (damato)
- Fixed: the gauge in the mail transfer window would never reach 100%
  (damato)
- Fixed: enforced proper Read/Write window parameters when dealing with
  ARexx to avoid things going terribly wrong (damato)
- Fixed: ADDRDELETE would throw Enforcer hits if no alias was provided
  (damato)
- Fixed: ADDREDIT couldn't edit/create distribution lists without
  throwing Enforcer hits later (damato)
- Fixed: ADDREDIT would produce hits with bogus BIRTHDATE parameters
  (damato)
- Fixed: ADDRRESOLVE was utterly broken and crashed the system right
  away (damato)
- Fixed: GETSELECTED wouldn't initialize <stem>num.count in empty folders
  (damato)
- Fixed: INFO SCREEN would return an empty string if YAM was iconified
  (damato)
- Fixed: MAILCHECK didn't set <STEM>ONSERVER correctly (damato)
- Fixed: MAILINFO broke in 2.3p1 and would omit the folder name part in
  <STEM>FILENAME if an INDEX was supplied (damato)
- Fixed: neither MAILREAD or MAILWRITE could really activate windows
  in the GUI (damato)
- Fixed: MAILWRITE accepted bad WINDOW values (damato)
- Fixed: Enforcer hits when filtering by message body or headers (damato)
- Fixed: Enforcer hits when replying or forwarding a message attached
  to another message (damato)

  (damato)
- Fixed: Enforcer hits when clicking the [Filter] button or selecting
  the address to send the reply to (damato)
- Fixed: preselection didn't work at all if "Download new mail on startup"
  was enabled (damato)
- Fixed: no mail was downloaded automatically if "Download large messages"
  was disabled (damato)
- Fixed: it was possible to abruptly interrupt a mail transfer by using
  "Check version" (damato)
- Fixed: calling "Show last message" would also disrupt the current mail
  transfer and cause further calamities later on (damato)
- Fixed: Enforcer hit when clicking the support URL <www.yam.ch> in the
  About window on startup (damato)
- Fixed: the results in the Search window could get out of sync with the
  message list (damato)
- Fixed: even if "Display all texts" was disabled, some operations in the
  Read window could still trigger text parts to be displayed entirely
  (damato)
- Fixed: "Next/Previous message in thread" would fail most of the time;
  replaced the rudimentary algorithm this code was based on with a more
  advanced CRC32 checksum algorithm which in turn calls for an .index
  revision update - yup, this *REQUIRES ALL INDICES TO BE UPDATED*, but
  also wins you the possibility of sorting messages by the date they
  were sent or received, which has now been implemented for real (damato)
- Fixed: a gadget in the filter definition showed junk when switching
  to a remote filter and viceversa (damato)
- Fixed: remembers again the last active message in a folder and jumps
  to this message if the folder is selected again (damato)

  writing a new mail in a folder belonging to a mailing list (damato)
- Fixed: the title of the file requester for importing MIME viewers & types
  was not localized (damato)
- Fixed: the [Okay] button in the About window got lost on restart (damato)
- Fixed: the keyboard shortcut for "Security" in the address book works,
  now (krille)
- Fixed: double clicking mailto: links does something useful again; as
  an extra bonus, subject, CC and BCC fields are also correctly handled as
  in mailto:a@b.c?subject=test&amp;cc=b@c.d , and two URLs can appear in
  the same line without triggering side effects (damato)
- Fixed: temporary files for attachments cancelled in the Write window
  were not deleted (damato)
- Fixed: couldn't display raw messages stored in PROGDIR:folder (damato)
- Fixed: will now take care of spaces in path names when calling MIME
  viewers (damato)

  i.e. "Re: [list]subject", the first character in the edited subject
  got lost (charlie)
- Fixed: hiccup when finding a "%" character in attachment filenames
  (damato)

  was never used (damato)

  (tactica)

  with a more intelligent flex environment to make highlighting more
  accurate and fix the crashes with some HTML mail (damato)
- Changed: rewritten all the elementary TCP/IP routines to use separate
  transfer buffers, which should speed up transfers over slow connections
  (damato)
- Changed: "Program startup" & "Program termination" macros are also
  executed on Restart (damato)

  the Caps Lock key (damato)

  gadgets (damato)

  putting up a "PGP signature key is not correct" warning every time
  a PGP signed message is opened (krille)
- Changed: dates in the mail listview and other areas are now displayed
  using Locale settings (damato)
- Changed: will also honour the hidden JumpToNewMsg option wrt newly
  received messages (damato)
- Changed: the listview in the Search window will now be sorted by
  date by default (damato)
- Changed: personal sender info will only be displayed if only one
  matching Real Name is found in the address book (damato)
- Changed: simplified the folder creation process (damato)
- Changed: removed the %h variable from the popup list for the Open and
  Close phrases, since it doesn't make much sense there (damato)
- Changed: string gadgets for email addresses and real names are now
  limited to 150 and 30 characters, respectively (damato)

  (tactica)

  in the status bar (damato)

  string gadget (damato)
- Changed: trying to load an apparently invalid address book will now
  put up a requester offering the user to load the file as a line
  separated list of names and email addresses rather than blindly
  loading whatever is thrown at it (damato)
- Changed: made the GUI a bit less obstrusive at getting the focus
  while the user is typing away elsewhere (damato)
- Changed: "Show last message" remains disabled now until there is actually
  some message to show (damato)
- Changed: sizes of uuencoded attachments are displayed with a "~" (tilde)
  character in the Read window meaning this is just an approximation
  (damato)
- Changed: email addresses in the usual a@b.c form are (again) clickable
  just like mailto: links, and as a bonus they also appear highlighted
  just like URLs (damato)
- Changed: CTRL-C will now break the application, while CTRL-D will
  restart it immediately (damato)
- Changed: updated default remailer address (damato)

  rendered obsolete (damato)

  groups, and nested at the user's discretion (damato)
- Added: SMTP & POP3 TLS1/SSL3 support for stunnel servers, using
