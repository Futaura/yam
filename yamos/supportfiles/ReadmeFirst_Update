               YAM 2.4p1 bugfix release - Installation notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an incremental update that fixes some last minute bugs introduced
in YAM 2.4. You need a complete YAM 2.4 installation (AmigaOS or MorphOS)
for this update to be of any use to you.


What's new since YAM 2.4?
-------------------------
Developer: Jens Langner (damato)

- Fixed: failed to quote messages containing attachments (damato)
- Fixed: the "Abbreviation" string gadget in the Glossary reset itself
  to "- new -" every time the contents were deleted (damato)
- Fixed: if AutoSave was disabled for the internal editor (AutoSave = 0),
  it tried to delete an inexistant ".autosave0" file (damato)
- Fixed: it could happen that a temporary letter file was used for
  different Write windows at once (damato)
- Fixed: the "Export..." item in the popup menu exported the whole folder
  contents (damato)

- Changed: it is now actually compatible with the most common MBOX
  formats, e.g. MBOXRD <http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html> (damato)
- Changed: added support for the DST variable created by Facts, rendering
  SummerTimeGuard emulation obsolete (damato)
- Changed: no longer disables the pattern field in the ASL file requester
  opened to attach files (damato)
- Changed: no longer complains if it can't save ENVARC:mui/YAM.cfg on exit
  (damato)

- Added: new hidden option "AutoColumnResize" for YAM to resize the NList
  columns when switching folders if the option is enabled (it is by default)
