Developer: Jens Langner (damato)

- Fixed: failed to quote messages containing attachments (damato)

  to "- new -" every time the contents were deleted (damato)
- Fixed: it could happen that a temporary letter file was used for
  several Write windows at once (damato)

  AutoSave option was set to 0 (damato)
- Fixed: couldn't exit if ConfirmOnQuit was enabled and YAM was iconified
  (damato)
- Fixed: the HIDE option prevented the application from popping up if
  MUI's own appicon or the commodity system were used (damato)
- Fixed: the FOLDERINFO ARexx command returned the wrong ID number for
  folders containing "sent and received" mail (damato)
- Fixed: changing the folder type failed to refresh the message list
  (damato)
- Fixed: forgot to pack messages when they were imported into compressed
  folders, causing all sort of calamity (damato)
- Fixed: folders that "lost" their directory were automatically recreated
  as folders of type "outgoing" (damato)
- Fixed: cancelling the password requester in the folder settings window
  would create a folder protected with an empty password (damato)
- Fixed: the "Export..." item in the popup menu would export the whole
  folder contents (damato)
- Fixed: a direct mail import to a compressed/encrypted folder didn`t
  let YAM save this imported mails as compressed or encrypted (damato)
- Fixed: the "check signature" menuitem in the read window was sometimes
  disabled even if the mail had a signature to check. (damato)
- Fixed: the "save decrypted message" menuitem within the read window
  didn`t correctly work within a compressed/encrypted folder.

- Changed: it is now actually compatible with the most common MBOX
  formats, e.g. MBOXRD <http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html> (damato)
- Changed: added support for the DST variable created by Facts, rendering
  SummerTimeGuard emulation obsolete (damato)

  opened to attach files (damato)
