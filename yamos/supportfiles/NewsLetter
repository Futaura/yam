1. The YAM Open Source team releases YAM 2.4p1
==============================================

The YAM Open Source team is proud to announce the release of YAM 2.4p1.
This is an incremental release for those who had already installed YAM
2.4 and is available as a patch for any CPU flavour of YAM 2.4, including
the MorphOS version. You can download it now following the links at
http://www.yam.ch/archive.html


/What's new since YAM 2.4?/

Developer: Jens Langner (damato)

- Fixed: failed to quote messages containing attachments (damato)
- Fixed: the "Abbreviation" string gadget in the Glossary reset itself
  to "- new -" every time the contents were deleted (damato)
- Fixed: it could happen that a temporary letter file was used for
  several Write windows at once (damato)
- Fixed: would try to delete an inexistant ".autosave0" file if the
  AutoSave option was set to 0 (damato)
- Fixed: couldn't exit if ConfirmOnQuit was enabled and YAM was iconified
  (damato)
- Fixed: the HIDE option prevented the application from popping up if
  MUI's own appicon or the commodity system were used (damato)
- Fixed: the FOLDERINFO ARexx command returned the wrong ID number for
  folders containing "sent and received" mail (damato)
- Fixed: changing the folder type failed to refresh the message list
  (damato)
- Fixed: forgot to pack messages when they were imported into compressed
  folders, causing all sort of calamity (damato)
- Fixed: folders that "lost" their directory were automatically recreated
  as folders of type "outgoing" (damato)
- Fixed: cancelling the password requester in the folder settings window
  would create a folder protected with an empty password (damato)
- Fixed: the "Export..." item in the popup menu would export the whole
  folder contents (damato)
- Fixed: the "Check PGP signature" menu item in the Read window was
  sometimes disabled even if the message had a signature to check (damato)
- Fixed: the "Save decrypted message" menu item in the Read window
  didn't work as it should in compressed/encrypted folders (damato)

- Changed: it is now actually compatible with the most common MBOX
  formats, e.g. MBOXRD <http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html> (damato)
- Changed: added support for the DST variable created by Facts, rendering
  SummerTimeGuard emulation obsolete (damato)
- Changed: no longer disables the pattern field in the ASL file requester
  opened to attach files (damato)
- Changed: no longer complains if it can't save ENVARC:mui/YAM.cfg on exit
  (damato)

- Added: new hidden option "AutoColumnResize" for YAM to resize the NList
  columns when switching folders if the option is enabled, which it is by
  default (damato)
- Added: confirmation requester before cropping attachments (damato)

3. About the new hidden option "AutoColumnResize" in YAM 2.4p1
==============================================================

The latest NList.mcc class update made it possible for YAM to quickly
display thousands of messages when switching folders; however, you may
have noticed that the columns were getting scrambled and they ended up
with a width of 1 pixel until you saved your MUI settings or let YAM
do it on exit. Some people were reporting this as a bug or missbehaviour,
and also some requested back the previous behaviour of YAM 2.3p1
concerning the display.

As a temporary solution to this problem, the hidden option "AutoColumnResize"
has been implemented in YAM 2.4p1. This option will default to Y (Yes) -
as long as it is enabled, YAM will resize the columns itself, the downside
being that you will lose the quick message listing while switching folders.
Those who have a very fast Amiga, are running the MorphOS version or simply
don't have very voluminous folders won't probably notice the difference,
but if you have a low-end machine or have to open some large folders
frequently, you probably want to simply configure the list to your
tastes, "snapshot" the main YAM window and then set this option to N (No).
This way, you get the best possible performance as NList won't be
recalculating the columns widths every time and even large folders will
be opened in a flash.


4. Errata in YAM 2.4 documentation
==================================

Contrary to what is stated in the YAM 2.4 documentation, the ARexx command
FOLDERINFO should return 7 in the TYPE stem for folders of type "sent and
received". In other words, the statement

                       0 - normal
                       1 - incoming
                       2 - outgoing
                       3 - sent (for the default "Sent" folder)
                       4 - deleted
                       5 - sent and received
                       6 - sent

should actually say

                       0 - normal
                       1 - incoming
                       2 - outgoing
                       3 - sent (for the default "Sent" folder)
                       4 - deleted
                       6 - sent
                       7 - sent and received

because this is what you will get when using YAM 2.4p1.


5. The "yamnews" mailing list is about to be closed
===================================================

As previously announced, the "yamnews" mailing list that has been online
for several years at Yahoogroups is about to closed - by the time you
read this, it is probably defunct already.

However, feel no sorry, because those who asked for the service to stay
have already been subscribed manually to the new "yam-announce" mailing
list. Everybody else who can't cope with the traffic of the users' list
and only want to be notified of new releases is hereby invited to join
by sending a message to yam-announce-request@freelists.org with the
subject "subscribe" (without the quotes) - confirm your subscription
and you are set.


6. The future of YAM
====================

YAM 2.4p1 is probably the last incarnation of YAM2 as you know it today.
Along the following months YAM will be suffering major changes in its
internal workings, meaning that the next major release is unlikely
to be available until we are well into 2004, though an intermediate
version will appear as AmigaOS4 is released. Among the new features
you can expect in future releases are:

- Improved NList & NListtree MUI classes. Changing the order of your
  folders will no longer be a pain, and switching folders will immediately
  list everything even on "low-end" Amigas without having to mess with any
  hidden options.

- Threaded message list as an option. For the first time ever, YAM will let
  you browse threads and save a precious time as you don't need to read
  every single message when it is clear that you aren't interested in a
  thread.

- Updated toolbar class. The ancient Toolbar.mcc will be dropped in
  favour of the much better Speedbar.mcc, allowing for a much better
  control over the layout of the toolbars and leaving behind all the
  annoying bugs in the old class.

- Updated internal editor. While TextEditor.mcc made a great service to YAM
  along the last few years, it is starting to show its age. There's simply
  no chance to fix its bugs as the sources were lost many moons ago, and we
  all want YAM to remain as the flagship Amiga mailer, stability being
  priority number 1. Therefore, expect YAM to use an updated texteditor
  class in the next release.

- Built-in HTML mail read capability.

- Fully multithreaded design. Abort mail transfers and filters without
  losing your hair in the process.

- Reworked multiuser capability. Become another user with a couple of
  mouse clicks.

- Support for newly introduced technologies. LDAP directory services
  and IMAP4 are already planned.

- Seamless integration in the latest OS upgrades. For instance, AmigaOS 4
  users will be able to be notified about new mail in AmiDock, read their
  email with a single button click, and do not worry ever again about
  charsets.
