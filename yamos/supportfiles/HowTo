This is a very incomplete draft of a guide for new members of the
YAMOS team, as well as people who just want to compile YAM.


How to compile YAM from a clean SAS/C 6.58 installation
=======================================================

First download 'dev/mui/mui38dev.lha' from Aminet and install the
includes.

YAM uses a custom tool to generate header files for some of the MUI
classes. Before compiling YAM you must compile this tool:

 smake GenClasses

and create the needed header files (you also need to do this from time
to time when the classes are updated):

 smake ClassInfo


Rules
=====

- Parts of YAM are being rewritten to archieve a more modular, object-
  oriented design. Doing this transition two different styles are used
  throughout the project. In the classes directory you'll find the new
  sources. Read the StyleGuide before making changes to these files or
  adding new classes - especially the paragraph about tabs. Remember:
  Follow the style! The old sources use a tab setting of 3, but use
  spaces instead of real tabs. Follow the style!

- Before doing any major or questionable changes, bring it up on the
  YAMos-dev mailing list. Don't make any changes based on personal
  preferences without discussing it first. Remember that you are not the
  only one using YAM, and other developers may disagree with your ideas.
