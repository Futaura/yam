DESCRIPTION

     YAM (Yet Another Mailer) lets you send and receive electronic mail
     over the Internet and maintain archives of messages in your computer.
     The idea came to Marcel Beck in 1995 when he first tried using email:
     the programmes available at the time were either powerful but
     complicated to configure, or else used a too limiting graphical
     interface. The goal, therefore, was to program a cross between
     AdMail and AirMail, with a few ideas from Pegasus Mail.

     YAM made its first public appearance in early 1996 under the
     "mailware" concept. The unexpectedly enthusiastic response
     from the public led to a steady development of YAM that reached
     its finest hour in version 1.3.5, the last incarnation in the
     "classic" series. By then, YAM had turned into one of the most
     popular Amiga programmes ever, and won Marcel the appreciation
     and several awards from the Amiga community thanks to its
     simplicity and ease of use.

     Unwilling to stop at that point, Marcel spent almost two years
     developing YAM2.  In the summer of 1999, a greatly improved YAM
     set some of the standards that would be lately imitated by other
     popular Internet applications. In November 2000, Marcel finally
     gave up out of lack of time and motivation, but was yet kind enough
     to release the "final" YAM 2.2 together with its sources under the
     GNU General Public License. On this day and age, Marcel Beck is
     still fondly remembered by many as one of a selected few who made
     a difference on the Amiga.

     Today, after YAM 2.3 and 2.3p1 fixed some of the most outstanding
     problems in the original sources and almost 18 months of hard work
     have been spent, the YAM Open Source team is proud to make the legend
     continue with YAM 2.4, the most powerful Amiga mailer to date.
