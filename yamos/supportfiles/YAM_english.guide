@NODE "INTR" "Introduction"

INTRODUCTION


YAM  (Yet  Another  Mailer) lets you send and receive @{" electronic mail " LINK "MAIL" 0} over
the Internet and maintain archives of messages in your computer.

The  idea for YAM came to me in 1995, when I first tried using E-mail. The
programmes   available  then  were  either  powerful  but  complicated  to
configure,  or else used a graphical interface but with few functions. The
goal  therefore  was to program a cross between AdMail and AirMail, with a
few ideas from Pegasus Mail.

The  unexpectedly  enthusiastic  response  to  Version 1.2 led to a steady
development  of  YAM  culminating  in Version 2.2, which is much more than
just an upgrade for the popular Version 1.3.5.

As of YAM 2.3, YAM is now maintained by the YAM Open Source Team.


Features of YAM

Straightforward @{" installation " LINK "INST" 0} and @{" configuration " LINK "TUTO" 0}, taking only a few minutes.

Easy operation using buttons, menus, keyboard and @{" drag&drop " LINK "Drag" 0}.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "NEWI" "NewIcons"

NewIcons

The NewIcons provided with YAM were drawn by Ash Thomas. I have provided a
complete  set  with program icons, appicons and toolbar icons all drawn in
the  standard 32 colour palette, this means that you won't loose any pens.
The  icons  do  get updated, so if you email me I will send you the latest
version.  Suggestions  and constructive criticism is also appreciated. You
can also catch me on IRC (IRCNet and ANet) on channel #amiga as Abstruse.

Many  thanks  to  Paul  "lanky"  Demark  for  all  the  emails, irc chats,
suggestions  and  improvements,  I  have  also  added status newicons (the
little icons) which complete the set.

Before  I  get  swamped  with  emails  asking how I got a pattern into the
window borders on the preview picture: check out Birdie (currently 1.5) on
aminet, or at http://www.vgr.com/birdie/

This  is  version  0.8  of  the  icons (they aren't complete, as YAM isn't
complete either), but this version is much better than v7. The icons don't
move  down  and  right a pixel, they animate just like newicons do. I have
also  drawn them so you can turn off text (via MUI) and they will stay the
same size. Text wasn't needed (icons are suppose to replace text) and they
look very professional now.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "INST" "Installation"

INSTALLATION


Installation by using the installer

Open  the 'Install' folder, double-click the icon 'English' and follow the
instructions  given  by  the  installer.  If you have already installed an
older  version  of YAM please restart your Amiga after the installation of
YAM 2.4.


Manual installation

If you don't have the Amiga Installer or for some reason you are unable or
unwilling to use it, proceed as follows:

- Create a directory for YAM on your hard disk.

- Copy the files 'YAM', 'YAM_english.guide' and '.taglines' as well as the
  directories 'Charsets', 'Icons' and 'Rexx' to this new directory. Rename
  the guide file to 'YAM.guide'

- (If appropriate) Copy the file 'YAM.catalog' for your language to

      'LOCALE:Catalogs/<your language>'

- Copy all MUI-libraries (mcc/mcp) from the directory 'MUI' to...

      'MUI:libs/MUI'

- Create an entry in your 'S:User-Startup' assigning 'YAM:' to the
  directory you have created for YAM 2.3, for example...

      'Assign YAM: Work:Internet/YAM'

- If you have a 68040 or 68060 CPU, you might want to use a version
  of YAM optimized for those processors. To do this, just use the
  supplied "spatch" CLI utility, which you should copy to your C:
  directory for a future use. Now, assuming you have both "YAM" (020)
  and "YAM.060.pch" in your RAM: disk, you might use:

      1.RAM Disk:> spatch -oYAM_060 -pYAM.060.pch YAM

  which would result in a fresh new 'YAM_060' executable that should
  now be copied to your YAM: directory to replace the standard 020
  compile.

  If you have some older YAM version already installed, you probably
  can use this instead:

      1.RAM Disk:> spatch -oYAM_060 -pYAM.060.pch YAM:YAM

  to replace your old YAM executable in one single step.

- Reboot your Amiga

@ENDNODE
@NODE "TUTO" "Quickstart"

QUICKSTART

This chapter is meant to be a step-by-step guide to the way YAM 2.3 works.
It  is  assumed that you already have installed YAM 2.3 on your system and
that you're using Miami as your TCP/IP software.

 1. Get the following information from your internet provider:

 - your e-mail address
 - the internet address of the mail-server (so called POP- or SMTP-server)
 - your password, required to log in on the mail server

As  an  example  here's  the  setup for a fictitious user named 'John Doe'
living  in  Britain.  His  e-mail  address  is 'jdoe\@provider.uk' and the
address   of  his  mail-server  is  'mail.provider.uk'.  His  password  is
'nguz56'.

 2. Start  YAM by double-clicking its icon. After the copyright window has
closed,  the  main  window  should  open  with two listings (folder list &
message list) and a row of buttons.

 3. The program must be configured before you can do anything else. Choose
'Configuration'  from  the 'Settings' menu or simply click the button with
the  question  mark to open the configuration window. The sheet which then
appears  is  called  'First  Steps'  and  this is where you must enter the
information needed for data transfer. Following our example this is:

                    Real Name:     John Doe
                    Email address: jdoe\@provider.uk
                    POP3 server:   mail.provider.uk
                    Password:      nguz56
                    Time zone:     GMT

For security reasons the password textfield only shows stars, one for each
character  you type. If daylight saving time applies to you at the time of
installation  switch  on  the  adjustment  for  it (right beneath the time
zone).

 4. YAM  allows you to define a text passage which will be appended to all
of your e-mail as a complimentary closing phrase. To define it you have to
click  on  'Write'  in the list on the left hand side of the configuration
window.  On  the  page  appearing  now  select  the  text field 'Greetings
phrase', delete the original text by hitting RAmiga-X and insert something
such as:

                    Kind regards,\\n  Joe

The control string \\n forces a new line after the word 'regards'.

 5. Save  the  settings  now by clicking on [Save]. YAM now has sufficient
data to allow you to write your first message.

 6. After  saving  the  settings you're back in the main window. Click the
button  'Write'  (sixth  button  from  the  left) or choose 'New' from the
'Message'  menu. The editor window will open. Insert the e-mail address of
the recipient into the 'To' textfield (like 'jdoe\@provider.uk'). Normally
of  course you would put someone else's address, but right now you want to
test  the  system, so put your own address in instead. Insert two or three
words  to  indicate the subject into the 'Subject' textfield. ('Test' will
do  nicely  for  this one!) Now click in the large blank area and type the
actual message.

If  you were using YAM in a normal way, and wish to send copies (including
hidden  copies) to anyone, this can be done by clicking on 'Options', thus
activating  the  third of the three sheets (Message, Attachments, Options)
of the Write window.

 7. Assuming you are not currently online (Miami is not running), click on
[Send  later].  This sends the message to the 'Outgoing' folder as opposed
to transmitting the message right away [Send now].

 8. Now start Miami and connect to the internet. Open the 'Outgoing' folder
by clicking on 'Outgoing' in the folder list contained in the main window.
Send  the  message  by  clicking  the 'Send' button (fifth button from the
right  hand  side).  The  transfer  status  window  will appear and report
progress as YAM logs in on the mail-server and sends the message.

 9. As  you've  probably noticed the mail has vanished from the 'Outgoing'
folder.  Don't  panic!  It has been moved to the 'Sent' folder. The letter
symbol  in  the  list  has  a little stamp on it now, which means that the
message has been sent successfully.

10. When  you  double-click  the  message  the read window will open.  You
should  be  able  to  recognize  the text written by you. The lines in the
upper  part  of  the  message  have  been inserted by YAM and contain data
needed for mail transfer (the so-called "headers").

11. Since you've written the mail to yourself you should start looking for
new  mail  now.  Click the read window to the background or close it, then
click on the 'Get' button (sixth button from the right hand side).

12. The  transfer  status  window  you  saw before opens again and you can
watch  how  YAM  downloads  your  mail from the mail-server. Provided that
everything  runs  as  it  should a requester will open up with the message
that  you  have received new mail. You can read the mail in the 'Incoming'
folder.

If  you've  made  it  this  far  without  major  problems you now know the
essential  functions  of  YAM.  For further explanations and more detailed
information on single topics please read the following chapters.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "MA00" "Main window - folder list"
@TOC "MA_W"

Main window - FOLDER LIST

The following four standard 'mailbox' folders are always present:

Incoming:  This  mailbox holds new messages addressed to you. Whenever you
download  new  mail, this is where the new messages will go initially. You
can  however  redistribute incoming messages to other folders, as desired,
by the use of @{" filters " LINK "CO03" 0}.

Outgoing: This mailbox holds the messages which you have written and which
you intend to transmit when you are next online.

Sent:  Here you can see the messages which you have already sent. Messages
are   moved   to  this  box  (from  'Outgoing')  when  they  are  actually
transmitted.  Again you can use @{" filters " LINK "CO03" 0} to transfer sent messages to other
folders.

Deleted: This box contains messages marked for deletion. Normally messages
are  not  actually  deleted  from  the  hard disk until you quit YAM. This
allows you to recover messages deleted earlier in the session.

Using  the  @{" folder menu " LINK "MAM2" 0} menu you can create more folders to hold messages
which  you  have  received  and/or  sent,  so you can arrange the mails in
whatever way you like, including arranging them in groups.

The folder list can have up to five columns: Name of the folder, number of
messages  (in  total,  new or unread) as well as the size of the folder in
bytes.  Which of these columns is actually shown depends on how you set up
@{" Lists " LINK "CO08" 0} in the configuration. The column widths can be adjusted by using the
mouse  to drag the thin lines separating the column headings in the folder
list itself. The order of the columns can be modified by moving the column
headers.

You  can  rearrange  the folders either by @{" Drag&Drop " LINK "Drag" 0} or by clicking on the
column heading. A little arrow on one of the column headings shows how the
messages are sorted. A second click on the same heading reverses the order
of sorting (Z->A instead of A->Z).

If  the  name  of  the  folder  is shown in white, this means that the box
contains  new  or  unread  mail. When the numerical indication is missing,
this  shows  that  the  folder  has  not been scanned (which saves storage
space). All of this applies to folder groups, too.

If  you  "park"  the  mouse pointer over the list for some seconds, a help
bubble containing information about the current folder pops up.

To  see  the  contents  of  any particular folder click on that row in the
folder  list.  The message list appears at the right, maybe after a slight
pause.

Doubleclicking  an  entry in the list opens the @{" configuration window " LINK "FO_W" 0} where
you can edit the properties of the selected folder or group.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "MA01" "Main window - message list"
@TOC "MA_W"

Main window - MESSAGE LIST

The  message  list can have up to eight columns, the contents being set in
the @{" Lists " LINK "CO08" 0} configuration.

Message  status:  An  icon showing the @{" status " LINK "MA0S" 0} of the message (new, unread,
read, etc.)

Sender/Recipient:  E-mail address or, in this case, the name of the sender
or  recipient  of  the message, depending on the type of mailbox. When the
message  was sent to several people at the same time a little icon appears
in front of the name, showing three tiny heads.

Subject: Subject of the message. When the messages are sorted according to
the subject, the prefixes Re: and AW: are ignored.

Date:  The  date  of  posting  of the message, calculated according to the
local  time (for you). For this to work, both you and the sender must have
set your correct @{" timezone " LINK "CO00" 0}.

Filename: Name of the file containing the message.

Reply address: Contents of the Reply-To: header in the message. If this is
missing, then the sender's address is given (the From: header).

Size: Size of the message.

The  column  widths  can  be  adjusted by using the mouse to drag the thin
lines separating the column headings in the message list itself. The order
of the columns can be modified by moving the column headers.

A  little  arrow  in the one of the column headings shows how the messages
are sorted. One click on a column heading causes the messages to be sorted
according  to  this  property. A second click on the same heading reverses
the  order  of sorting (Z->A instead of A->Z). To set the second sort key,
keep  the  Shift  key  pressed while clicking on the column heading. These
changes are only temporary; if you want to make them permanent you must do
this in the @{" folder settings " LINK "FO_W" 0} window.

If  you  "park"  the  mouse pointer over the list for some seconds, a help
bubble containing information about the current message pops up.

A  double  click  on an entry in the list opens a @{" Read window " LINK "RE_W" 0} and displays
the  corresponding  message.  You  can  use  the mouse to move messages to
another  folder.  Click  on an entry and drag down (holding the left mouse
button)  to mark a block of messages. Then click and @{" drag " LINK "Drag" 0} the marked block
to the left, into the folder list, and drop it onto the chosen folder.

Main window - FOLDER MENU


Folder/New folder...

Creates  a  new folder and inserts it below the current one. If the folder
directory already exists (e.g. a folder of another user), select "Existing
directory".  To  create  a  new  folder you can either use YAM's "Internal
defaults"  or  copy the settings from the current folder ("Like current").
In the following dialogue, enter the name for the directory that should be
created.  Only  change the parent directory (path) if absolutely required.
Now a @{" configuration panel " LINK "FO_W" 0} opens where you can modify the properties of the
new folder.


Folder/New folder group...

Creates a new folder group and inserts it at the end of the folder list.
Groups are useful to group your folders in categories, saving also precious
state space in your folder list. Folders can also be nested, i.e. you can
insert a group into another group.


Folder/Edit...

Opens  a  @{" configuration panel " LINK "FO_W" 0}  where you can  modify the properties of the
current folder. If a group is selected, only its name can be changed here.


Folder/Delete

Removes the current (user defined) folder, asking for confirmation first.
When a group is deleted, its contents just move one place up in the tree.


Folder/Order »  Save | Reset

Saves  or  restores  the order of the folders in their @{" list " LINK "MA00" 0}. This order is
also saved when modifing the folder settings.


Folder/Search...

Opens the @{" Search window " LINK "FI_W" 0}, which allows you to find any particular message.


Folder/Filter

Applies the  user-defined  @{" filters " LINK "CO03" 0}  to all messages in the current folder.
Filters  are  of  the  form  'On  query , take action', the options being
defined in the configuration settings.


Folder/Empty trash

Actually deletes the messages in the 'Deleted' folder.


Folder/Update index

Scans  the  directory  for the current folder and builds a new index file.
Normally  YAM  updates the index file automatically, as needed. However it
can be useful to  force an index update after a crash or in the event of a
problem.


Folder/Flush indices

Removes  the  indices  of  the  user  defined folders, which is helpful if
you're  low  on  memory.  If you change to one of these folders at a later
time, the index will be reloaded from the hard disk.


Folder/Import...

Allows  the  import of a mail file created by a different application. The
file  must  be  in  standard  UUCP mailbox format as generated by external
mail server  client programs like AmiPOP or IMAP clients. Such a file  may
contain  several messages which are identified by their 'From:' and 'Date'
headers.


Folder/Export...

Saves  all  the  messages  in the current folder to a single file, so that
they can be read by a different e-mail client. (See also under Import.)


Folder/Send queued mail

Transmits all messages in the Outgoing mailbox (except for those which are
on 'Hold').


Folder/Exchange mail

First  fetches  new mail from your mail server and then sends the messages
in  the  Outgoing  mailbox.  This  simply combines the actions of 'Get new
mail' and 'Send queued mail'.


Folder/Get new mail

Attempts  to  connect to the mail server, checks whether there is new mail
waiting and  if  so  downloads it into the 'Incoming' mailbox. If you have
specified more than one @{" POP3 server " LINK "CO02" 0}, they will all be checked in turn.


Folder/Check single account

If  you  have  set  up  several POP3 servers, you can use this function to
check any single server.

Message/Read

Loads the selected message into the @{" Read window " LINK "RE_W" 0}.


Message/Edit

Allows you to edit a message you have composed earlier.


Message/Move...

Moves  one  or  more messages into another folder. You can also do this by
@{" dragging " LINK "Drag" 0}  the  message(s)  from  the message list into the @{" folder list " LINK "MA00" 0} and
dropping them onto the desired destination.


Message/Copy...

Allows you to duplicate a message. The copy is identical to the original
apart from its filename on disk.


Message/Delete

Moves one or more messages to the 'Deleted' folder (from which they can be
recovered  if  needed).  If  you  want  messages  actually  to  be deleted
immediately, then check "Remove messages immediately" in the @{"Miscellaneous" LINK "CO14" 0}
configuration settings. The  <Del> key  works as  a keyboard  shortcut for
this menu item, while <Shift-Del> forces immediate deletion from  the hard
disk, regardless of the configuration settings.


Message/Print

Sends  the  readable  part  (text  and  headers)  of the message(s) to the
printer.


Message/Save

Saves  the text (and headers) of one or more messages, creating a separate
file  for  each  message.  Should  you  want to save the messages in their
original (UUCP) format, use @{" Folder/Export " LINK "MAM2" 0}.


Message/Attachments »  Save

Saves  the  attached  files  from  one or more messages in a directory you
select.


Message/Attachments »  Crop

Deletes,  without  further  warning, the MIME attachments from one or more
messages,  in order to save storage space. A notice about the deleted data
is written into any message cropped in this way.


Message/Export...

Saves one or more messages to a single file, so that they can be read by a
different e-mail client. (See also @{" Folder/Import..." LINK "MAM2" 0}.)


Message/Write

Opens the @{" Write window " LINK "WR_W" 0}, in which you can compose a new message.


Message/Reply

Use  this to reply to a message which someone has sent to you. Subject and
recipient  headers  are  filled  in automatically and the original text is
quoted.  It  is also possible to select several messages which will all be
quoted   in  the  same  reply  and  sent  back  to  the  original  senders
("Multi-reply").


Message/Forward

This  lets you send the contents of an e-mail on to another recipient. The
subject  and  the body text are copied across whereas a new message header
is  created.  At  the beginning and the end of the quoted text YAM inserts
the  phrases for forwarding, which you can define in the @{"Reply" LINK "CO06" 0} settings in
the  configuration.  You  can also select multiple messages, in which case
these are combined into a single forwarded message ("Multi-forward").


Message/Bounce

This  lets  you send a message on to another recipient, with no changes at
all.  Only  the To: field of the header is changed and a couple of Resent:
fields  are added. The phrases defined for forwarded messages are not used
here.


Message/Select  »  All | None | Toggle

Selects all the messages in the  current  folder, clears any  selection or
toggles  the  selection (i.e. exchanges  selected  and  unselected items),
respectively.


Message/Save address...

The address of  the  sender  of  the selected message (or the recipient's,
depending  on  which  type of mailbox is open) is added to your @{"address book" LINK "AB_W" 0}. If
multiple  messages  are  selected  or if a message has several recipients,
then you get the option of creating a new distribution list.


Message/Set status to  »  Unread | Read | Hold | Queued

This changes the status of one or more messages. Thus you can release held
messages in the Outgoing mailbox, or mark unread messages as read.


Message/Change subject...

This  alters  the  subject  of  one  or  more  messages,  so you can amend
irrelevant  Subject: fields in messages you have received. To preserve the
capability  of tracing a thread back, the original subject is saved in the
message headers as X-Original-Subject.


Message/Send

Makes a connection to the mail server and transmits the selected messages.
If  you  want  to send all the messages in the Outgoing folder, then it is
better to choose @{" Folder/Send queued mail " LINK "MAM2" 0}.

FOLDER SETTINGS


Apart  from  the  four  mailbox folders 'Incoming', 'Outgoing', 'Sent' and
'Deleted' you can create any number of user-defined folders. These folders
are   useful   e.g.  for  archiving  received  and/or  sent  mail  or  for
administrating mailing lists.


Name

The  name  of  the  folder  will  appear in the folder listing in the main
window.

    Example:  YAM mailing list


Path

This  is the  path in which the messages, the .fconfig file and the .index
file of the actual folder will be saved. Usually this is a subdirectory of
the  actual  basic  folder directory, but you can specify any other place,
like another hard disk partition for example.

    Example:  YAM_ml


Max. age

If  you  like  you  can  make  YAM delete messages exceeding a certain age
automatically.  To do so, just drag the slider to select a value different
from  zero (which stands for  the  maximum age of  the mail in DAYS). Then
switch to the  'Start/Quit'  configuration sheet and  activate the  option
'Delete old mail'.

N.B.:  Messages  with  the  status  'new'  or 'unread' will not be deleted
automatically.


Type

Here  you  choose  if  the  folder  is for incoming and/or sent mail. This
influences the column titles and whose address is displayed in the message
list.


Mode

Folders  can  be  protected  with  a  password  and/or  be  compressed  if
necessary. There are the following modes available:

normal                    no password protection, no compression
                          + fast
                          - no protection of your e-mail from third persons
                            with access to your computer

simple protection         simple password protection, no compression
                          + fast
                          - your e-mails are protected within YAM only

compressed                XPK compression without password protection
                          + saves hard disk space
                          - slow, no protection for your e-mail

compressed with password  XPK compression with password protection
                          + saves hard disk space, good protection
                          - slow

The XPK software package is needed for compressing. It is not contained in
the  YAM  archive  but  can  be  downloaded e.g. from Aminet for free. The
settings for the compression library can be found at @{" Miscellaneous " LINK "CO14" 0}.


Sort by

Here  the primary order of the messages in the chosen folder is specified.
You  can  have  the  mail  sorted  by message date, date received, sender,
recipient,  subject,  size  or  status. Concerning the message status, the
messages will be sorted in the following orders:

  new > unread > read > replied > forwarded
  error sending > protected > in queue > sent

With the option 'Rev' the order will be reversed (e.g. Z-A instead of A-Z)


Then by

Here  the  secondary  order  of  the  messages  in  the  chosen  folder is
specified.  If for example mails are sorted by subject on a first instance,
messages with the same  subject can be sorted by date or author using this
second key.


AppIcon stats

Enable this if you want this folder's statistics to be added to those
shown in the application icon YAM usually puts on the Workbench screen.
By default, only the stats for the 'Incoming' folder are noted there.

Exactly what data appears under the appicon depends on the label set in
the @{" Miscellaneous settings " LINK "CO14" 0}.


Mailing list support

Since  not  all mailing list servers set the reply-to field to the correct
address  (which would be the  mailing list  address), YAM can  help you to
work around this problem, offering also some  other nice tricks for a good
measure.

When  you reply to a mail contained in this folder, YAM checks if the data
in the TO: field of the original message is matched by the contents of the
'To: pattern' field - if they do, the address entered in the 'To: address'
field will be inserted as the recipient instead of the recipient's address
contained  in the original message.

Additionally, if  you  have entered a  'From: address', this will  replace
your e-mail address when  posting  to  the  mailing  list. This  is useful
if you use different e-mail addresses for different mailing lists, or just
want to avoid SPAM.

You can also enter a 'Reply-To: address' in case the mailing list software
doesn't set this.

Lastly, the "Autodetect" button  will try to guess  what "To: pattern" and
"To: address" data should be used by scanning the first 5 messages  in the
folder using the  Smith & Waterman  algorithm to  search for  similarities
between strings. This  should make it  easier to find the  corrent mailing
list pattern.


Signature

Here  you  can select the  signature  that will  be used by  default  when
replying to messages coming from this mailing list  (the ones with a "To:"
header matching the pattern given in "To: pattern").

CONFIGURATION

YAM has a huge number of options, which can be set up in the configuration
window. The  program options  are divided  into  15 sheets  which  can  be
selected  by clicking  on  the corresponding word in  the left part of the
configuration window.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO00" "Configuration - First steps"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - FIRST STEPS (Essential information needed for YAM to work)


---- Minimal configuration -----------------------------------------------

Full Name

Your  real name and surname. Please take care that this field is filled in
correctly. Please don't use quotation marks in your name.

  Example:  John Doe


E-mail address

This is your e-mail address, consisting of your <username>\@<domain name>.

  Example:  jdoe\@provider.uk


POP3 server

The  Internet  address  of  your  system's  mail server. This server which
normally  is  a  computer  of your ISP (internet service provider) must be
capable of working with the POP3 protocol. If you don't fill in this entry
YAM will use the address of the SMTP server.

  Example:  mail.provider.uk


Password

The password which is asked from you by your mail server. This password is
possibly  but  not necessarily identical to the password you use to log in
on your ISP (e.g. using PPP).

  Example:  nguz56


---- Time zone -----------------------------------------------------------

Timezone

The time and date displayed by YAM in the message list is always converted
to  your  local time. This guarantees correct sorting of messages from all
over  the  world sent out from different time zones. The time zone is part
of  the message's date and specifies the difference between local time and
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Should the time zone have a special value (e.g.
a  difference  of  half  an  hour), it  can  be defined in the environment
variable YAM_TZ.

  Examples:  GMT+1 (for Germany)
             GMT   (for the U.K.)
             GMT-5 (for U.S. EST e.g.  New York City)

Normally  YAM  will  get the time zone from your Locale settings, and this
selector will be ghosted.


[ ] Add adjustment for daylight saving time

This  option  is to be activated during daylight saving time. By doing so,
one  hour  will be added to the time zone value. YAM automatically changes
to/from daylight saving time if SummertimeGuard is installed.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO01" "Configuration - TCP/IP"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - TCP/IP  (Information needed for Internet mail transfer)


---- Send mail (SMTP) ----------------------------------------------------

Server

The  Internet  address  of  the  system  you're sending your mail to. This
server which usually is a computer of your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
must  be  capable  of processing the SMTP protocol.


Port

The port number of the SMTP service is 25 in most cases. If it's different
from that, enter the number here.

  Example:  mail.provider.de


Domain

When sending mails your Amiga has to identify itself to the SMTP server by
giving its address (HELO command). The SMTP server decides whether you are
allowed to use it by checking this address. Normally YAM identifies itself
by  sending  the  domain  part  of  your  e-mail  address, which will work
just fine in most cases. However, if you encounter some trouble and get an
error  message from your SMTP server when trying to send mail, you'll have
to edit your domain setting, e.g . by inserting a name for your computer.

  Example:  mYAMiga.provider.uk


[ ] SMTP server allows 8bit

Originally  only the US-ASCII character set was allowed for use in e-mail,
which  meant  that  the  users  were forced to do without modified vowels.
Instead  of  'ä' they had to write 'ae'. The reason for that was that many
servers  only  processed  the  first 7 bits and simply cut off the 8th bit
crippling  the  e-mail by doing so. This problem was solved by introducing
the  MIME  quoted-printable  standard,  which  converts all 'unauthorized'
characters  to  7  bit before transfer and reconverts them to the original
characters  on  delivery.  Modern  mail  servers  don't have problems with
non-US-ASCII  characters  any more, so messages do not necessarily have to
be  converted.  If you are absolutely sure that your server supports 8 bit
transfers,  you  can  switch  on  this  option  and  save  a few bits when
transferring.  The  best way to find out if your mail server supports this
is  to write a message to yourself containing modified vowels and see what
happens.


[ ] Use SMTP AUTH

Enable this  if  you want  to use  SMTP Authentication, whereby  YAM  will
request  your  mail  server  to  use  an  extra  authentication  layer  as
documented in RFC 2554. You will need to fill in another couple of User Id
/Password fields in this case.

If your ESMTP server does not support SMTP AUTH, you will receive an error
message when trying to send email. Ask your ISP if in doubt.


---- Receive mail (POP3) -------------------------------------------------

Apart  from the primary POP3 server already defined in @{" First steps " LINK "CO00" 0} you can
set upto 15 extra POP3 accounts here; the names appear in the list  on the
left and clicking on a name brings up the relevant  details on the  right.
Note  that the account can be for the same user on a different server,  or
a  different user  on the same  server. Either way, you can  check for new
mail with a single mouse click. Click on [New] to insert the data required
for  a  new  e-mail  account.  With  [Delete] you can  (obviously)  delete
accounts.


POP3 server

The  Internet  address  of  the  system  you wish to fetch mail from. This
server,  which  will be a computer of your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
in  most  cases, must be capable of processing the POP3 protocol.

  Example:  pop.provider.de


Port

The port number  of  a  POP3 server is usually 110.  If your server uses a
different port, enter that number here.

  Example:  109


User ID

Insert  the  User ID for the POP3 server here.  In most cases this will be
identical to  the  username  in  your  e-mail  address. However, there are
exceptions,  so check the instructions from your ISP. (YAM then constructs
the full account name in the form <User ID>\@<server>.)

  Example:  jdoe


Password

The  password  which  has to be sent to the mailserver for logging on. You
can  leave  this field empty for security reasons. If you do, the password
will be asked to you whenever YAM checks for new mail.

  Example:  nguz56


[ ] Active

Switch   this  option on  to have the selected POP3 server checked for new
mail  whenever you use the  "Get new mail"  button in the  toolbar, or the
equivalent item in the "Folder" menu. If you don't want this email account
to be checked automatically, switch this option off and  use the menu item
'Folder/Check single account' from the main window instead.


[ ] Use POP3 SSL/TLS

Activate this option to use SSL based encryption under the TLS protocol as
described in  RFC  2595. This adds extra  security to prevent  the typical
eavesdropping and hijacking  attacks which POP is commonly subject to, and
will use port 995 instead of the usual 110.

The "with STLS" gadget will force  the use of the POP3 STARTTLS extension,
adding  another layer of security to the communication, using  again  port
110.

If your POP3 server doesn't support any of this, you will receive an error
message when checking for new mail. Also, AmiSSL is required.


[ ] Login using APOP

Normally  the User ID and the password are transmitted  as plain text when
connecting  to a POP3 server. Under certain circumstances, this could be a
security  risk, and for this reason  modern  POP3 servers support the APOP
authentication, which  transmits  the  data  encrypted with a key which is
delivered  by the server. If your POP3 server does not support APOP you'll
receive an  error message when checking for new mail. In that case, switch
this option off.

[ ] Delete mail on server

If this option is activated, new mail will be deleted after downloading it
from the mail server. The  messages will be deleted only  after they  have
been  successfully  saved to your computer. If the POP3 account is used by
several  people,  or if you'd like to access your account again later from
another computer, this option can be deactivated.


New, Delete

Let you set up a new POP3 account or delete the account currently selected
respectively.

@NODE "CO02" "Configuration - New mail"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - NEW MAIL  (Set up for downloading mail)


---- Download ------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-selection

After  establishing  a link with the POP3 server a @{"preselection window" LINK "TR_W" 0} may
open  showing  a list of all new mail in the POP3 mailbox. This allows you
to  decide  whether  to download, delete or leave a message on the server,
according to its size, topic or sender. For pre-selection to work properly
the server must support the TOP command (which most of them do).

 never:              pre-selection is deactivated
 large messages:     only messages bigger than a size defined by you will
                     be displayed in pre-selection
 always:             every message will be displayed in pre-selection
 always, only sizes: all messages will be displayed but only their sizes
                     will be shown. The advantage of this method is that
                     it is pretty fast.


Size limit

If pre-selection  is activated, messages which exceed the  size given here
will be highlighted. This way you can avoid downloading messages with huge
attachments. The size is given in kilobytes. If you don't want to  use any
limit, just insert '0'.

In  everyday  use, the settings 'pre-selection = large messages' and 'size
limit=100  kB'  have  proved  to  be  advantageous.  With this setting the
pre-selection  window will only appear if at least one of the new messages
exceeds 100 kilobytes in size.


[ ] Transfer window

Here  you  can  decide  if  you  want  to  see  the @{"transfer window" LINK "TR_W" 0} while
receiving  or sending mail. With 'automatic' it only opens if you manually
initialize the transfer, staying closed while YAM automatically checks for
new mail.


[ ] Avoid duplicates

If  you  choose  not to have YAM delete the mail on the server after down-
loading it will be downloaded again next time YAM gets your mail, so every
message  will appear twice in your mail folder. To prevent this, switch on
the 'Avoid  duplicates'  option - as long as this option is activated, YAM
keeps  track  of all your downloaded messages in the '.uidl' file and uses
special  commands of the POP3 server to avoid downloading the same message
twice. If the POP3 server supports these UIDL commands, this check will be
done rather quickly. If the server doesn't support these commands YAM will
try  to  read  the  Message-ID  using the TOP command instead of the UIDL-
commands.  In case  the mail server doesn't support any of these commands,
this option must be deactivated.


[ ] Update message status

If  this  option  is  activated, all messages in the 'Incoming' folder are
marked  from  'new'  to 'unread'. This way you can instantly recognize the
new mail that was downloaded the last time you've fetched mail.


---- Automatic operation -------------------------------------------------

Check for new mail every [xx] minutes

Here  you  can  specify a time interval after which YAM will automatically
recheck  your mail  server for new mail. To deactivate this option, simply
enter zero.

  Example:  15 minutes


[ ] Download large messages

Whenever  new  mail  is downloaded automatically (every x minutes or using
ARexx), the  selection  window won't pop up since the user is likely to be
working with  another program at the time, or not in front of the computer
at all. Mails exceeding the size limit won't be downloaded and will remain
on the server if this option is not activated.


---- Notification --------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Requester

When  YAM has downloaded new mail, it will display a requester showing the
number of new and deleted messages.


[ ] Sound

When YAM has downloaded new mail, it will play a sound file. The datatypes
library is used  for playing, so the sound file can be of any format (like
AIFF  or  WAVE)  as  long as you have installed the appropriate datatypes.
Click the small arrow (PLAY symbol) to test the sound.

  Example:  Data:Audio/Newmail.snd


[ ] Command

This  is  the  program  to  be  executed when new mail arrives. Insert the
command as you'd do at a command line interface. If it is an Arexx script,
you have to put the 'RX' command in front of the name of the script.

  Example:  RX YAM:rexx/Newmail.YAM

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO03" "Configuration - Filters"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - FILTERS  (user defined mail filters)


The  purpose  of  a  mail  filter is to process mail according to criteria
defined by  the  user. Whenever a mail matches a specified pattern, it can
trigger  certain  actions.  Applications  for the use of  filters are, for
example:

 - automatically moving mail from a mailing list to a specified folder
 - automatic processing of incoming inquiries by sending pre-defined
   answers
 - automatic deletion of unwanted spam (advertising by e-mail, a real pest
   nowadays)
 - automatic re-directing of mails to another recipient.

You  can  define up to 100 of such filters. The list on the left shows the
names  of  all the filters defined so far. Click on a name to bring up its
details on the right, spread across three sheets - Options, Comparison and
Action.  Click  on  [New] to create a new filter or use [Delete] to delete
one.  Filters  are  executed  in top-to-bottom order, therefore you should
place filters that delete or move messages at the bottom of the list.


---- Options sheet -------------------------------------------------------

Name

The filter's name is merely for recognition and not of any other use.


[ ] Remote filter

With  a remote filterm new email can be checked on the POP3 server without
being  downloaded completely. The POP3 server must support the TOP command
to be able to process this kind of filter. In contrast to 'normal' filters
only  the  contents  of  the  e-mail  headers  can be searched for certain
patterns. For obvious reasons, functions like forwarding or moving e-mails
will  not  work  with remote filters. If remote filters are activated they
might  slow  down  downloading  e-mail, but they are handy as a protection
against spam or 'mailbombs'.


[ ] Apply to new mail

Activate  this  option  to  have  all  new  mail processed by this filter.
Processing will be initiated automatically after receiving new mail.


[ ] Apply to sent mail

Activate  this  option  to  have  all  sent mail processed by this filter.
Processing will be initiated automatically after sending mail.


[ ] Apply on request

If this  option  is  activated, the filtering process  will be  started by
clicking  on  the Filter button in the main window or by choosing 'Filter'
from  the  'Folder' menu. This way you can also process old messages which
do not necessarily have to be in the Incoming folder.


---- Comparison sheet ----------------------------------------------------

Search in

Here  you  can  define  what  part of the e-mail should be scanned for the
search  pattern. If you want a field of the message header to be searched,
you  can choose one from the list which appears when clicking on the cycle
gadget, or  select  'Other  field' and insert the name of the header field
into  the  text  field  on the right side of the cycle gadget. If 'Message
body'  is  selected, the  whole  message  except  for the  headers will be
searched.  Please note that this type of full text search may take quite a
long  time  when big mails are processed (YAM will have to decode mails in
MIME format).

  Example:  Other field:  X-Mailer


Comparison

The instruction comprises the comparison operator and the search pattern.

YAM supports the following comparison operators:

 =   the text which is compared must match the search pattern
 <   the text must be "less" than the search pattern
 >   the text must be "greater than" the search pattern
 <>  the text must be different from the search pattern
 IN  the text must match pattern contained in the file which is specified
     in the text field to the right side of the comparison cycle gadget.
     Instead of a search pattern itself, the name of a file has to be
     inserted here, containing one or several lines of search patterns. In
     this way it is possible to create a so-called 'Killfile' containing a
     list of e-mail addresses. Click on the page icon to edit the file.

Note that  the comparison operators '<' and '>' work differently according
to the type of field. YAM knows that a message size or date is numeric and
sorts   these  in  numerical  order, but  for  fields  such  as  'Subject'
alphanumeric  order  is  used, as in a telephone directory, so James < Jim
and 12 < 2.

The  search pattern may contain @{"AmigaDOS wildcards" LINK "DOSW" 0} such as ?, #?, (a|b) or
[abc].  Please  note  that  the  search  pattern  [YAM]#?  will filter all
messages  beginning  with  Y, A or M. For filtering mails out of a mailing
list  (for  example  a mailing list related to YAM) you would do better to
use the search pattern #?YAMML#? or have the filter compare the 'Reply-To'
field with the address of the mailing list.

  Example:  = YAM 1.3.#?


Address/Name

If you make the filter search a header field containing an e-mail address,
you can specify here whether the search pattern should be processed on the
address (e.g. jdoe\@provider.uk) or the author's name (e.g. 'John Doe').


[ ] Case sensitive

Activate  this  option  if  you  want the filtering process to distinguish
between normal and capital letters.


[ ] Substring search

If the search pattern consists of only a part of the header field which is
to  be  searched  through, you  must  activate  this option. YAM will then
complete the search pattern with #? internally.

It  is  possible to combine two search criteria. The cycle gadget lets you
select how this is to be done:

 none            don't use a second criterion
 and             both criteria must be satisfied
 or              at least one of the two criteria must be met
 exclusive or    either one or the other of the two criteria must apply,
                 but not both


---- Action sheet --------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Bounce

Activate  this option to have mail matching the search criteria bounced to
another  recipient. For  instance, you  might use  this  to  automatically
resend certain email to your mailbox at work.

The new recipient's  e-mail address must be  inserted into the  text field
next to the option.

  Example:  jdoe\@athome.de


[ ] Forward

Activate  this option when you want e-mail matching the search criteria to
be forwarded to another person. The new recipient's e-mail address must be
inserted into the text field next to the option.

[ ] Reply

If  this  option  is  activated,  YAM will send an  automatic reply to any
mail matching the search pattern. Enter the filename containing  the auto-
answer text into the text field next to this option.

  Example:  YAM:Auto-Texts/Answer1.txt


[ ] Execute

If  this  option  is  activated,  an  external  program  will be  executed
whenever an email matches the  search criterion. YAM will send the path of
the  e-mail  to  the  external program as a starting parameter. Insert the
command  line into the text field next to this option. Please note that if
you want an  ARexx script to be executed, you will have to explicitely put
the 'RX' command first.

  Example:  rx YAM:Rexx/Subscribe.rexx


[ ] Play sound

Activate this option to have a sound played whenever a message matches the
search  pattern. The sound file name is to be inserted into the text field
next to this option. YAM uses the datatypes library for playing the sound.
Click the small arrow (PLAY symbol) to test the sound.

  Example:  Data:Audio/Ihatespam.wav


[ ] Move

If  you activate this option, YAM will move any e-mail matching the search
pattern  to  another  folder.  You  can  select the folder with the pop-up
button.


[ ] Delete

If this option is activated, all messages matching the search pattern will
be deleted. (You probably guessed that... ;) )


[ ] Don't download

If this option is activated, any message matching the search pattern  will
not  be  downloaded  from the  mail server. You  can use  a remote  filter
together with this option if several persons share the same POP3-account.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO04" "Configuration - Read"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - READ  (Settings for reading e-mail)

---- Message header layout -----------------------------------------------

Header
If  'full' is selected the full header will be displayed. Select 'none' if
you don't want to see any of the header. When you switch to 'selected' you
can  specify  yourself  which  header fields should be visible in the read
window.  For  specifying  the fields you can use any @{"AmigaDOS pattern" LINK "DOSW" 0}. The
fields  FROM, TO, DATE and SUBJECT are predefined as default settings. The
header layout can also be changed (temporarily) in the read window itself.

  Example:  (From|Subject|Date|X-Mailer)

Sender info
If  a  mail's  sender  is  found  in  YAM's  address book, YAM can display
additional  information  in  the  header part of the read window. If 'data
only'  is  selected  YAM will list information like name, date, snail-mail
address,  description,  etc.  contained  in the address book entry. Select
'data  and  image'  to make YAM display a picture of the sender (of course
there's  got  to  be  one in the address book ;)) in addition to the other
data.

[] Wrap headers
Choose whether to show a long header on one line or to break it across two
or  more.  In the first case you will need to use the horizontal scrollbar
in order to see all of the information.

---- Message body layout -------------------------------------------------

Separate sig.
It  has  become  a  custom  to  separate the signature from the text of an
e-mail  using  two  dashes  and  a  space.  If  you don't like this way of
separation  you  can  define  another  here.  Apart  from the setting 'two
dashes'  you  can select between 'separator bar', 'blank line' or even 'no
signature' to have no sig. at all.

Colored text
Text  passages  embedded  in  # characters will be highlighted by YAM in a
special  colour  (in the internal editor and in the read window). Here you
can define the colour used for that purpose.

Old quotes
The  colour  which  is  used to display quoted text can be selected in the
TextEditor  module of the MUI preferences. If there are multiple levels of
quoting,  an alternative colour will be used for the even (2nd, 4th, etc.)
levels. You can define that colour here.

[] Use fixed font
It  often  makes  more  sense  to  use a non-proportional font for reading
messages   since  the  layout  of  any  tables  will  be  distorted  using
proportional fonts. Don't forget to specify the font of your choice in the
'TextEditor' module of YAM's MUI settings under 'Fonts/fixed'.

[] Display all texts
If  this option is activated and the message contains attachments not only
the  actual  message  text  will  be  displayed  but  also the attachments
themselves, as long as they are of the 'text' type.

Text styles
YAM  uses  the characters _ / * and # to indicate underlined, italic, bold
and  coloured text. For certain special documents (like source codes) this
can  make  things difficult because some characters are suppressed. So you
have the option of switching the rendering of text styles on or off.

---- Other options -------------------------------------------------------

Charset translation
When  reading  messages  this  character-set  converter  is  used. In some
countries  not  all  letters  can be written with the standard ISO-Latin-1
charset  of  the  Amiga. In Poland for example the AmigaPL charset is very
popular  since  it  contains  the  missing  characters.  YAM supports such
charsets  for reading and writing messages. In the charset directory there
are some examples. A conversion table is set up as follows:

         1st line:   YCT1 - YAM Charset Translation
         2nd line:   Description of the converter
         3rd line:   Resulting charset, e.g.  iso-5589-1
    further lines:   (optional) FROM source charset (e.g. iso-5589-1)
                     (optional) TO target charset
                     (optional) HEADER
                     Old character=New character

Characters  are  defined  in  hex-code  with  a  $  in  front or as actual
characters.  So a character definition can look like this: $E5=$61 or like
this: å=a

With  the  HEADER  keyword,  the charset conversion is also applied to the
messages headers.

[] Multiple windows
With this option selected, each message which you choose to read will open
its own read window. Up to four such windows can be open at the same time.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO05" "Configuration - Write"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - WRITE (Settings for writing new messages)

---- Message Header ------------------------------------------------------

Reply to
Normally  this  field should remain empty. The default reply-to address is
your  e-mail address. If want to use a different address (AND ONLY THEN!!)
you can insert that different address here.

  Example:  jdoe\@home.uk

Organization
If  you  want  the  name of your organization, school, club or whatever to
appear in the header of your message, insert it here.

  Example:  Doe Donut Production Ltd.

Extra headers
If  you  need to add one or more special extra lines to the header of your
mail  for any reason, you can insert these header lines here. If you would
like  to  insert  several  lines  separate them by inserting '\\n'. PLEASE
DON'T  make  use of this feature unless you have the appropriate knowledge
of the structure of internet e-mail.

  Example:  Content-Language: uk\\nKeywords:Pattern, YAM, Internet

---- Message body --------------------------------------------------------

Welcome phrase
YAM  will insert this text at the beginning of every new message you write
(except  for  answers and forwarded messages). You can define a line break
by inserting '\\n'.

  Example:  Hello,\\n

Closing phrase
This  text  is  inserted  at  the end of every new message you write, just
before the signature separator. You can insert a line break with '\\n'.

  Example:  Kind regards\\n\\nJohn Doe

Charset translation
This  character-set translator is used when writing messages. You can find
further information on that in the chapter @{"READ" LINK "CO04" 0}.

   Example:  YAM:charsets/Latin1toUSASCII  (deletes mutated vowels, etc.)

---- Editor --------------------------------------------------------------

Word wrap
When  you  save  a newly written message it will be formatted to make sure
that  no  line  has more characters than the value specified here. You can
also choose if YAM should insert line breaks as you type or if this should
be delayed until you send the message.

  Example:  76

[] Wrap as you type
Activate  this  option  if  you  would  like the internal editor to insert
linebreak  codes  while  you're  typing  the  message.  This way you avoid
unwanted surprises when the text is formatted later on saving the message.
But be aware of the fact that the subsequent insertion or deletion of text
might be a little less comfortable.

External editor
If  you  do  not  like  the  internal  editor  and wish to use another one
(thereby  forgoing automatic spell checking, text styles and glossary) you
can  insert it here. Remember to insert the full path for the editor and a
possible qualifier such as '-sticky' or '-keepio'.

  Example:  C:Ed   or   C:CED -keepio

[] Launch immediately
Activate this option, if you would like the external editor to be launched
automatically as soon as you start creating a new message. By doing so you
won't have to click on the [Editor] button in the write window.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO06" "Configuration - Replying"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - REPLYING (Replying and forwarding messages)

---- Forwarding ----------------------------------------------------------

Initial phrase
This  text  will  be  added  at  the beginning of the original text of any
message  you  forward. Click on the pop-up button to select from a list of
variables which can be inserted (for example %r stands for the name of the
recipient,  %s  stands  for  the subject, etc.). When the text is inserted
into  the  message,  YAM  replaces  the variables by their values which it
reads from the forwarded message.

  Example:  *** Forwarded message, originally by %n on %d: ***\\n

Terminating phrase
This  text  will be inserted at the end of a forwarded message (but before
the  greetings  phrase).  Click  on the pop-up button to select a variable
from the list (for subject, date, sender, etc.).

  Example:  *** End of forwarded message ***\\n

---- Replying ------------------------------------------------------------

Default reply phrase
When  you reply to a message, YAM can automatically insert three different
phrases  in  the  new  message:  greetings  (Open), an introduction to the
quoted  message (Intro) and a closing phrase (Close). Use the cycle gadget
to  select  one  of  these phrases and enter it in the field on the right.
Click  on  the  pop-up  button  to  select  a  variable from the list (for
subject, date, sender, etc.).

  Example:

    [Open]    Hello %f,\\n
    [Intro]   On %d, you wrote:\\n
    [Close]   Kind regards

Alternative reply phrase
Communicating  via  internet  often means writing in another language. For
that  reason YAM is capable of using an alternative reply phrase set which
will   be   activated   automatically  whenever  the  recipient's  address
corresponds to a user-defined pattern. This way you can for instance use a
German  version  of the reply phrase set for addresses in Germany, Austria
and Switzerland while using the English version for all other countries.

  Example:

    [Open]    Hallo %f,\\n
    [Intro]   Am %d schriebst Du:\\n
    [Close]   Mit freundlichem Gruss

Use with these domains
Whenever  the  recipient's  address corresponds with this @{"AmigaDOS pattern" LINK "DOSW" 0}
the alternative reply phrases will be used.

 Example: #?.(de|ch|at) (Addresses of countries with German mother tongue)

Mailing list reply phrase
To answer a message belonging to a mailing list, another set of phrases is
available.  They  will  be  used  if the message that is being answered is
stored in folder for which mailing list support has been activated

(@{"folder configuration" LINK "FO_W" 0}).

  Example:

    [Open]    Hi!\\n
    [Intro]   On %d, %n wrote:\\n
    [Close]   Kind regards

Quote message using
The character(s) specified in  the editing  field plus a space will be put
in front of each line of the original message. Click the  pop-up button to
select a variable for the sender's initials.

  Example:  %i>

Quote external using
The character(s) specified in  the editing  field plus a space will be put
in front of each line  quoted from an external  source.  This is used when
inserting or pasting text using the "alternate quoted" method.

  Example:  |

[] Quote empty lines
Normally  the  quotation  character  is inserted at the beginning of empty
lines  contained  in  the  quoted message. If you don't like that, for any
reason, you should deactivate this option.

[] Verify recipient address
If this option is activated YAM will check if the sender and the recipient
have  the same address. If the From field of the message header happens to
be different from the ReplyTo field of the message header the user (that's
you)  can  choose  whom  to  reply  to. That way it's fairly easy to reply
privately to a message from a mailing list.

[] Strip signature
Activate  this  option to avoid quoting the signature (since you'll delete
the  signature  anyway in most cases). This option will work only when the
signature  in  the  quoted message is separated from the actual message by
the standard separator '-- '. That is 2 strokes AND a space.

Configuration - SIGNATURE  (Definition of the signature and taglines)

You  can  define and use one standard and up to two alternative signatures
within  YAM  (e.g.  one  signature  for  private  mail and another one for
business).  Clicking  on  the cycle button in the upper left corner of the
window  you  can  display and edit the signatures in the small text editor
window.

[] use signature
When  this  option is activated a signature will be inserted at the end of
each message you write.

[Edit in external editor]
Click  on  this  button  to  open  the external editor you have defined in
'Configuration/Write/External editor' for editing the actual signature.

[Insert random tagline]
Click  on  this  button  to  insert the variable '%t' at the actual cursor
position  in  the  editor.  YAM  will  replace this variable with a random
tagline from the tagline file when processing a new message.

[Insert ENV:Signature]
Click on this button to insert the variable '%e' at the actual position in
the  editor.  YAM  will  replace  this  variable  with  the content of the
environment  variable 'SIGNATURE' when creating a new message. That way it
is  possible  to  have  random  values  inserted into the actual signature
automatically,  like  the  date, or the actual temperature or time or your
weight or whatever...

Tagline file
The  tagline  database contains tags, little poems or other very important
and  witty pieces of wisdom which can be selected randomly and be inserted
into  the  signature. There are collections of thousands of these taglines
on Aminet.

  Example:  YAM:.taglines

Tagline separator
Since  a tagline can consist of several actual lines the single entries in
the  tagline  file have to be separated from each other. Insert the string
that  is used for separating one tagline from another in your tagline file
into this text field.

Message list
Select the items you want to show in the message list.

[] Use fixed font
It often makes more sense to use a non-proportional font since the display
might  become  messed  up with proportional fonts. Don't forget to specify
the  font  of your choice in the 'TextEditor' module of YAM's MUI settings
under 'Fonts/fixed'.

[] Time in Swatch Beats
Enable  this  option  to  display  the time in Swatch Beats instead of the
hours:minutes format. This revolutionary unit of time, invented by Swatch,
a  Swiss  watch  manufacturer, divides the day in 1000 beats and abolishes
the different time zones. The meridian is the town Biel in Switzerland.

Configuration - SECURITY (Encryption, anonymous mail, protocols)

---- PGP -----------------------------------------------------------------

PGP path
The  famous  (some  people  and  authorities  might  even  say  notorious)
programme  PGP  (Pretty  Good  Privacy)  by  Philip Zimmermann is used for
encrypting,  decrypting  and  digitally 'signing' messages. Please install
PGP as described in PGP's manual and insert the full directory path of the
PGP  executable here. YAM recognizes automatically if you're using version
2.6 or 5.x.

  Example:  Work:Programs/PGP/bin/

Your PGP keys ID
If  you  want  to  sign  messages  with PGP YAM needs the shortcut of your
secret  PGP  key.  Click  on the pop-up button and select your key. If you
cannot  find  your  PGP  key  it could have two reasons: either PGP is not
installed  correctly on your system or you've specified the wrong path for
the PGP executable.

  Example:  0x70804A7B

[] Encrypt to self
Encrypting  messages  for  a  certain  recipient has one disadvantage: you
cannot  read  or edit the message any more after encryption. Activate this
option  to  be  able to read the message after encryption. YAM will enable
you  to  do  so by simply encrypting the mail using the recipient's key as
well as your own.

---- Anonymous mail ------------------------------------------------------

Re-Mailer
E-mail  address  of  the  re-mailing service you'd like to use. If sending
e-mail  anonymously  by  using a so called 're-mailer' this re-mailer will
erase  all  information  from  the  message  header that could be used for
identifying the original sender and then forward the message to the actual
recipient.  You  can  find  addresses  of  re-mailing services by having a
(www-) search engine examine the internet for 'remailer'.

  Example:  Remailer <remailer\@replay.com>

Header field
The  address  of the actual recipient of the message is transmitted to the
re-mailing  service  by  being contained in a header field or in the first
line  of the message. In the latter case simply create a blank line at the
beginning  of  the  re-mailer header line by inserting '\\n'. The variable
'%s'  will  be  replaced  by  the recipient's address. Please refer to the
documentation  of  the  re-mailing  service  for  information on the exact
format of the header line.

  Example:  Anon-to: %s

---- Logfiles ------------------------------------------------------------

Logfile path
YAM  will  save  the logfiles in the path specified here. The logfiles are
formatted as follows: Date/time/[code]/description of the event. The code,
which   consists   of   a  two-digit  number,  is  handy  when  running  a
computer-supported analysis of the logfile data since it is not related to
the selected language (whereas the description of the event is).

[] Split logfile
Switch  on this option if you want YAM to create a new logfile each month.
To  distinguish  the different files that will be created YAM includes the
date in the logfile name, e.g. YAM-Jan98.log. If you'd like one big single
logfile just leave this option deactivated.

Mode
If  you are not interested in having logfiles at all select 'none'. Select
'normal'   to  have  the  important  events  like  receiving/sending  mail
recorded.  In 'verbose' mode YAM will protocol every transferred e-mail in
detail.

[] Log all events
Deactivate  this  option if you're only interested in logging events to do
with the mail transfer (sending/receiving).

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO10" "Configuration - Start/Quit"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - START/QUIT  (Actions to be executed at startup and exit)

---- On program startup --------------------------------------------------

[] Load all folders
If  you  have  many  voluminous  archive  folders  you  can increase YAM's
starting  speed by deactivating this option. Furthermore deactivating this
option  will  save  memory,  because  only  the  index files of the system
folders  will  be  loaded  on  program  startup.  The  index  files of the
user-defined folders will then be loaded only when needed.

[] Mark new mail as unread
Switch  on  this  option  to  mark  all  messages with the status 'new' as
'unread' on startup.

[] Delete old mail
In  the  case that you have defined a maximum age for specific folders YAM
will  delete  all  messages exceeding this age before actually quitting if
this option is activated.

[] Remove deleted mail
Switch this on to make YAM empty the 'Deleted' folder when closing down.

[] Check birthdates
Switch  on  this option to make YAM search the address book on startup for
persons   whose   birthday   is   today.   This  way  you  can  send  your
congratulations at once, in case it's the birthday of one of your pals (or
maybe even business partners).

[] Send mail in outgoing queue
If  this  option  is  activated  YAM  will  search the outgoing folder for
messages to send on startup and ask you if you'd like to send them. Please
note  that  this  will  work  only  if  a  TCP/IP  stack  has  been loaded
previously.  You  can  temporarily  stop YAM from doing so by starting YAM
from a shell with the qualifier NOCHECK.

[] Download new mail
If this option is activated (and there's already a TCP/IP stack running on
your  system)  YAM  will  check  the mail server for new messages. You can
temporarily  stop  YAM from doing so by starting YAM from a shell with the
qualifier NOCHECK.

---- On program termination ----------------------------------------------

[] Send mail in outgoing queue
Activate  this  option  to make YAM look for ready to send messages in the
outgoing  folder before actually ending the program. If it's activated YAM
will  ask  you  if  you'd like to send those messages before quitting. (Of
course  it  will  do  so  only  if  there actually are any messages in the
outgoing folder.)

[] Delete old mail
In  the  case that you have defined a maximum age for specific folders YAM
will  delete  all  messages exceeding this age before actually quitting if
this option is activated.

[] Remove deleted mail
Switch this on to make YAM empty the 'Deleted' folder when closing down.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO11" "Configuration - MIME"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - MIME  (MIME viewers for attachments)

---- MIME viewers --------------------------------------------------------

The  program  selected by default for displaying attachments is MultiView.
Messages  in @{"MIME-Format" LINK "MIME" 0} contain a field called 'ContentType' in which the
type  of the encoded file is specified. You can define a different program
for  processing every single type of file. That is important for users who
do  not want to use MultiView for processing images and sound files or for
processing  file  types  that are not yet supported by datatypes. Click on
[New]  to  configure  a  displaying  program  or use [Delete] to delete an
entry.

Attachment type
This  is the type of the actual entry and corresponds with the ContentType
field contained in the message. You can select one from the pop-up list or
use  AmigaDOS  wildcards, e.g. 'image/#?' to use the programme for a whole
class of file types.

  Example:  image/jpeg

Extension
Filename  extension for the file type. This extension allows YAM to assign
the correct ContentType field for a file.

  Example:  jpg jpeg jfif

Viewer
Choose  a  program you'd like to use for displaying the attachment. Do not
forget  to  insert  a "%s" into the command line which will be replaced by
the filename when processing. The quotation marks in "%s" make it possible
to use spaces in the filename.

  Example:  TOOLS:Gfx/ViewJPG "%s"

Default viewer
This  viewer  will be used if the attachment doesn't match any of the user
defined types (see above).

  Example:  SYS:Utilities/MultiView "%s" SCREEN

[] Identify binary attachments
Some mail clients always use a ContentType field of...

  'application/octet-stream'

for  binary  attachments.  To still show such attachments with the correct
program,  YAM can search the viewer list based on the file name extenstion
of the attached file (see Extension).

---- Paths ---------------------------------------------------------------

Decode files to
This is the pre-selected directory to decode attachments into.

  Example:  Work:Data/In

Attach files from
Whenever  you  want to attach a file to a new message YAM will look for it
at this position first.

  Example:  Work:Data/Out

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO12" "Configuration - Address book"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - ADDRESS BOOK  (Visible columns, personal data exchange)

Columns
Select the items you want to show in the address book.

---- Personal data exchange ----------------------------------------------

[] Add personal data
Check  this  option  to create special message headers containing personal
data  like  your  postal address, phone number, homepage, date of birth or
URL  of your picture. If the recipient works with YAM too, (s)he will able
to  create  an  address book entry and fill it with your data. To get this
working,  add an entry in your address book containing your data (YAM will
find your entry based on the e-mail address).

Save sender's address
YAM  can  automatically  save  the  sender's address when you're reading a
message,  i.e.  it  creates a new entry in the address book. Choose one of
these modes:

  never                   Don't save addresses
  ask before              You'll be prompted every time if the
                          address should be saved
  if info available; ask  You'll only be prompted if there's personal
                          data of the sender available, otherwise the
                          address won't be saved
  if info available       The address will be saved automatically if
                          there's personal data of the sender available
  always                  All new addresses will be saved
                          automatically

Save photos in
The pictures of the senders are stored here.

  Example:  YAM:Gallery

Group for new entries
Alias  of  the  group  that will contain the new address book entries. The
group will be created if it doesn't exist.

  Example:  NEW

URL of your picture
If existing, enter the WWW address (URL) of a small photo of you here. The
URL  will  be  listed  in  the  header  of  every outgoing message if 'Add
personal information' is enabled.

  Example:  http://www.YAM.ch/gallery/BECK_Marcel.gif

HTTP Proxy server
If  you're  behind a firewall and only get into the Internet using a proxy
server, then you have to enter the address of that proxy server. Otherwise
it's not possible to download photos or get information about new versions
of YAM.

  Example:  proxy.access.ch:8080

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO13" "Configuration - ARexx"

Configuration - AREXX   (ARexx and AmigaDOS Scripts)

As  well  as  the  ARexx menu in the main window, which can hold up to ten
scripts, ARexx scripts can also be started by specified events. Thus it is
possible  with  two simple scripts to start up Miami in order to go online
and  fetch  new  mail  and  then  close Miami again once the mail has been
downloaded.

Name
The  title  of  the  script  as it appears in the ARexx menu, e.g. Browser
start.

Script
File name of the ARexx script, with any parameters (in usual ARexx fashion
but without a call to 'RX').

  Example:  YAM:rexx/StartBrowser.rexx

[] Open Console window
The  script  opens  a  window  for  input and output, while it is running.
Switch this option off if it is not required.

[] Wait for termination
Switch  this  option  off if you want the script to run in the background,
which means you don't want to wait for it to finish.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO14" "Configuration - Miscellaneous"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - MISCELLANEOUS

---- Paths ---------------------------------------------------------------

Directory for temp files
YAM requires this directory for saving some files needed while processing.
If you are short on memory (2 MB or less) you better choose a path on your
hard disk to avoid possible problems with large messages.

  Example:  RAM:t

---- Mailbox status AppIcon ----------------------------------------------

Position X   Y
Enter  the  desired  position on your workbench for YAM's AppIcon here. In
case  there  should already be another icon at this position the workbench
will  choose  a  'safe'  position for the AppIcon on its own (so you don't
have to worry about 'deleting' another icon).

  Example:  X 550  Y 144

[] Closegadget iconifies program
Normally the closegagdet (or ESC-key) will terminate the program. Activate
this option to iconify YAM instead.

---- Save/delete messages ------------------------------------------------

[] Confirm deletion of [xx] or more messages
If  this  option  is  activated  a  security  requester will appear before
deleting  a certain number of messages. This especially makes sense when a
number of two or more is selected.

[] Remove messages immediately
If  this  option is switched on messages won't be moved into the 'Deleted'
folder on deletion but will be erased from hard disk immediately. Doing so
saves  a little time and memory but on the other hand you won't be able to
reconstruct any message deleted by mistake.

[] Save sent messages
Activate  this  option  to  make  YAM  save  sent messages into the 'Sent'
folder.  You  can  select  this  as  well  specifically for each mail when
processing it.

---- Message tracking ----------------------------------------------------

Here  you  can  define  how  YAM  should  react  if a message's sender has
requested  a  condition  report (MDN) when writing the message by choosing
'Message tracking'.

 Ignore   - The request will be ignored completely and there won't be any
            report.
 Autodeny - The sender will be informed that you don't wish to send a
            condition report for the message.
 Accept   - The sender will be informed about the message's condition as
            requested.
 Ask user - You can decide in each case if you want to ignore, deny or
            accept the request.

In  addition  YAM's  reaction  can  be related to the event activating the
condition report:

 Display  - The message will be read or answered
 Process  - The message will be bounced or forwarded without reading
 Delete   - The message will be deleted without reading
 Filter   - The message will be automatically processed or deleted by
            a filter

[] Send at once
The  condition  report  will be sent immediately if there's a TCP/IP-stack
running. If not it will be saved to the 'Outgoing' folder.

---- XPK/LhA settings ----------------------------------------------------

Packer
Here  you  can  choose  the  XPK  library  you wish to use for compressing
folders  by  clicking on the pop-up button. Before doing so an XPK package
must  be  installed on your computer system. This package is not contained
in  the  YAM  archive.  You can obtain such a package from Aminet. You can
select the packer's efficiency using the slider bar on the right-hand side
of  the  pop-up button. The higher the value is the more effective and the
slower is the compression.

  Example:  NUKE 100%

Pack/protect
Click  on  the pop-up button to select the XPK library you wish to use for
compression  and  password  protection of folders. You can only select XPK
libraries  offering  password  protection. Specify the packer's efficiency
with the slider bar on the right-hand side of the pop-up button.

  Example:  HUFF 50%

Archiver
YAM  is capable of crunching one or more files before attaching them to an
e-mail. Suitable for that use are archive packers such as LHA, LZX or ZIP.
Enter  the  full  command  line  for your favourite packer. You can insert
variables  for  the  resulting  archive  and  the  source files (or a list
containing  the  source  files)  by  clicking  on the pop-up button on the
righthand side of the text field.

  Example:  LhA -a -m -i%l a %a
  Example:  BIN:LZX -a -m a %a %f

@ENDNODE
@NODE "CO_H" "Configuration - Hidden Options"
@TOC "CO_W"

Configuration - HIDDEN OPTIONS

YAM  recognises  a  couple  of  parameters which cannot be set through the
configuration window. You have to load the file YAM:.config into an editor
and alter the parameters in the [Advanced] section by hand.

LetterPart
Usually  the  first part of a multipart letter contains tha actual message
while  the  subsequent parts are the attachments. A few mail servers, like
GeoCities,  use  the  first  part  for  their advertisments which then get
quoted  in  a  reply  instead  of  the  actual  message.  With  the option
LetterPart you can correct this.

  Example:  LetterPart = 2

WriteIndexes
If  the contents of a folder are altered, YAM must rebuild the index. This
index  is  in  the  memory  and is saved back to the hard disk on a normal
exit.  In  the  event  that  the computer has to be rebooted (because of a
crash,  perhaps), YAM has to rebuild the indices on startup. Therefore YAM
will  save alterations to the index file at intervals of 120 seconds. This
time interval can be altered using the WriteIndexes option.

  Example:  WriteIndexes = 30

AutoSave
While  you're  entering big messages, YAM saves the contents of the editor
every  ten  minutes  as  .autosave0.txt  or  autosave1.txt  in the program
directory.  After  a crash you can load this file using "Text/Insert". The
AutoSave parameter contains the delay between two backups in seconds.

  Example:  AutoSave = 600

SupportSite
This  is  the address of the YAM homepage, which is used for access to the
user picture gallery and the version check.

  Example:  SupportSite = http://www.YAM.ch/

JumpToNewMsg
If this option is set to 'Y', YAM jumps to the first new or unread message
whenever you select a folder.

  Example:  JumpToNewMsg = N

AskJumpUnread
If  this  option  is  set to 'N', YAM won't ask if you want to jump to the
next/previous folder with unread  messages if you  are reading the last or
first message and select 'Next/Previous unread message' in the menu.

  Example:  AskJumpUnread = N

WarnSubject
If  this  option  is  set  to 'N', YAM won't warn you if you try to send a
message without a subject.

  Example:  WarnSubject = N

PrinterCheck
YAM does some printer checking before printing a message. This test can be
disabled because it's not fully compatible with some printer drivers.

  Example:  PrinterCheck = N

IsOnlineCheck
If  you're  using  Miami or AmiTCP Genesis, YAM can check if your Amiga is
really online. If you're using another TCP/IP software and YAM is claiming
about  a  missing  connection when you're online, then you must switch off
this option.

  Example:  IsOnlineCheck = N

IOCInterface
Specifies  which  Miami Deluxe/AmiTCP Genesis interface should be used for
the online check (see IsOnlineCheck).

  Example:  IOCInterface = ppp1

ConfirmOnQuit
If  this  option is enabled, YAM always ask for confirmation when you quit
it. By default YAM only ask for confirmation if there is some unsaved data
(configuration, address book).

  Example:  ConfirmOnQuit = Y

HideGUIElements
This  option  can  be  used  to  hide  some elements of the graphical user
interface.  The  following  values can be added: 4 for the toolbars, 2 for
the cursor position display in the editor and 1 for the status bar.

  Example:  HideGUIElements = 3

LocalCharset
This  is  the ISO name of the character set you're using on your computer.
The  default  iso-8859-1  (Latin-1)  works  for Western Europe and English
speaking  countries.  Polish or Russian users probably have to adjust this
option.

  Example:  LocalCharset = iso-8859-2

StackSize
Sets  the  stack  size for programs which are launched from YAM (e.g. MIME
viewers and PGP).

  Example:  StackSize = 40000

An  entry  must contain at the least the real name and the e-mail address.
The point of the Alias is to save typing; you can put a short nickname, or

entry.

kind  of  entry  (person,  list  or group) you will see a different set of
editing  fields.  Click on [Okay] to accept the changes, click on [Cancel]
to discard the changes.

PERSON
------

---- Electronic mail -----------------------------------------------------

Alias   (applies to person, list or group)
An  'Alias'  is  a  convenient  short name that identifes the address book
entry  unambiguously.  Its  function  is  to save typing - you can put the
alias  into  the  to  field of a message and YAM fills in the details when
sending  the  message.  If  you leave this field blank, YAM will create an
alias for the entry.

  Example: JohnD

Real Name
The person's first name and surname.

  Example: John Doe

Email address
The internet address to use to send e-mail to this person.

  Example:  jdoe\@athome.uk

PGP key ID
The hexadecimal code of this person's PGP public key. It is needed to send
the  recipient  a  PGP  encrypted  message.  Click on the pop-up button to
select  the  key  from  your  public  key  folder  (for  that, PGP must be
installed  on  your  system  and the key you're looking for must be in the
keyring folder).

  Example:  0x709B40C3

Home page
The  URL  for the person's homepage in the world wide web. YAM can connect
to  this address via your browser, provided that the appropriate script is
specified  in  the @{"scripts" LINK "CO13" 0} configuration for 'when double clicking a URL'.
All  you  have  to  do  is  to  click  on  the  button to the right of the
textfield.

  Example:  http://come.to/mars

---- Snail mail ----------------------------------------------------------

Street
Street and house number of the postal address.

  Example:  43 High street

City / ZIP
City and (ZIP) postcode (who would have guessed that...)

  Example:  Shrewsbury SY1 3PE

State / Country

  Example: Shropshire, England

Phone number(s)
One or more phone numbers (voice, FAX, cellular phone, whatever...)

  Example:  08154711

---- Miscellaneous -------------------------------------------------------

Description    (applies to person, list or group)
Any comment you'd like to enter to describe the current entry.

  Example:  My beloved one ;-)

Date of birth
The person's date of birth. Enter it in the format DD-MMM-YYYY.

  Example:  12-Dec-1967

---- Portrait ------------------------------------------------------------

Select
Here  you  can  select a picture (preferably a portrait) of the person. By
using the datatypes library you may use any kind of picture format as long
as  you've  installed  the datatypes needed for displaying it. If you want
this  picture  will show up whenever you display a message written by this
person. (See 'sender info' in the @{"Read" LINK "CO04" 0} configuration)

Download
You  can find a steadily growing number of portraits of other users of YAM
on  the YAM homepage. YAM can access this data bank automatically; all you
need  to do is to input the name and/or the e-mail address, connect to the
internet  and click the [download] button. YAM starts by getting a list of
available  photos  and  searching  it  for the named person. If found, any
information  missing from the address book entry (Name, e-mail address and
home  page)  is  made  good  and  the  picture downloaded and saved in the
gallery.  If you want to add your picture to the collection, please follow
the instructions on YAM's home page at http://www.YAM.ch/gallery.html.

LIST
----

Alias   as described above.

Return address
If  you'd  like  to maintain a small mailing list using a YAM distribution
list  you  will  have  to  correct  the reply-to addresses of the original
messages.  Otherwise  the  answer  to  an  e-mail would be returned to the
message's  author  and  not  to the mailing list. Enter the return address
you'd like to use.

  Example:  discussion\@provider.uk

Mailing list name
When maintaining a mailing list by using a YAM distribution list enter the
mailing  list's  name here. This name will appear in the 'To' header field
to help the recipient sorting the mail correctly by using filters.

  Example:  discussion-ML

Members
A  list  of  all  current  members of the distribution list. You may enter
aliases,  names  or complete e-mail addresses. Click on [New] to add a new
list  member,  [Delete]  to delete the highlighted entry or [Sort] to have
all entries sorted alphabetically.

GROUP
-----

Only the Alias  and Description  fields apply in this case.

@NODE "FI_W" "Finding messages"

FINDING MESSAGES

If  you  have  many messages and folders, it is easy to lose track of them
all.  You  know you have saved a message on a particular topic, but where?
YAM's search function solves this problem.

In  the upper half of the window you define the query. On the left you can
select one or more folders in which to search. On the right you define the
@{"Search criterion" LINK "FI_K" 0}.  In  the lower half of the window you will get a list of
messages which match the query.

Functions of the buttons

[everywhere]
Includes all folders in your search.

[Use filter settings]
Replaces the search criterion with a @{"Filter" LINK "CO03" 0}.

[Make new filter]
Sets up a new @{"Filter" LINK "CO03" 0} based on the current search criterion.

[Start search]
Begins  the  search.  Matching messages are shown in the results list. The
search can be stopped by clicking on [Abort].

[Select found messages]
Selects  all  the  messages listed as a result of the search, highlighting
them in the @{"message list" LINK "MA01" 0} of the main window.

[Read messages]
Displays   the  contents  of  a  selected  message  in  the  result  list.
Double-clicking on the name in the result list has the same effect.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "FI_K" "Finding messages - Search criteria"
@TOC "FI_W"

SEARCH CRITERIA

Search in
Here you select what part of the message is to be searched with the search
pattern. If you want to search in a header line you can either pick it out
of the list or else choose 'Other field' and type in the name of the field
in  the  text gadget on the right. 'Message body' causes the whole message
to  be  searched, apart from the headers. Note that a full text search can
take a long time. (YAM has to decode messages in MIME format before it can
search them.) Example : Other field X-Mailer

Comparison
The instruction has two components, the comparison operator and the search
pattern.

YAM supports the following comparison operators:

 =   the text which is compared must match the search pattern
 <   the text must be less than the search string
 >   the text must be greater than the search string
 <>  the text must be different from the search string
 IN  the text must match a pattern contained in the file which is
     specified in the text field to the right side of the comparison
     cycle gadget. Instead of a search pattern itself the name of a
     file is to be inserted here, containing one or several lines of
     search patterns. In this way it is possible to create a so-called
     'Killfile' containing a list of e-mail addresses. Click on the page
     icon to edit the file.

The comparison operators < and > work using alphanumeric ordering, as used
for names in a telephone directory, so James < Jim and 12 < 2.

The search pattern may contain Amiga-DOS @{"wildcards" LINK "DOSW" 0} such as ?, #?, (a|b) or
[abc].  Please  note  that  the  search  pattern  [YAM]#?  will filter all
messages  beginning  with  Y, A or M. For filtering mails out of a mailing
list  (for  example  a  mailing  list  related to YAM) you need to use the
search  pattern  ?YAM#? or have the filter compare the 'To' field with the
address of the mailing list.

  Example:  = YAM 1.3.#?

Address/Name
If  you want to search a header field containing an e-mail address you can
specify here whether the search pattern should be processed on the address

  (e.g.  jdoe\@provider.uk) or the author's name (e.g.  'John Doe').

[] Case sensitive
Activate  this option if you want the search to distinguish between normal
and capital letters.

[] Substring search
If the search pattern consists of only a part of the header field which is
to  be  searched  through  you  must  activate  this option. YAM will then
complete the search pattern with #? internally.

 These four buttons appear at the bottom of each sheet:

Send now
Prepares  the  message  for  sending, copies it to the outgoing folder and
tries  to  send  the mail at once. For this option to work correctly there
must be a TCP/IP stack running already.

Send later
Prepares the message for sending and copies it to the outgoing folder. Use
this button when working off line.

Hold
The  message  will  be prepared as described in [Send later] and copied to
the  outgoing  folder, but will be held back and NOT sent. Use this button
for  unfinished messages (e.g. if you'd like to make some additions to the
e-mail at a later time).

Cancel
Push  this  in  case you've changed your mind. BEWARE: All entries made in
this window will be lost. But don't worry too much, the security requester
will  pop  up  before YAM really discards any modifications you have made.
(It won't show if you haven't made any modifications at all, though).

Write window - ATTACHMENTS SHEET

You  can  add  one  or  more  files to your message. This way you can send
binary  files  such as archives, pictures, etc. via e-mail. You can choose
the  method  of  encoding (MIME or UUencoded) and write a comment for each
file.  Files  can  be  archived  automatically  to  reduce the size of the
message.

The attachment list contains five columns:

File  name, Size (in bytes), Contents, Encryption and Description. You can
re-order the files using Drag & Drop.

Buttons and Gadgets

Add file(s)
You can select on or more files which will be added as a new attachment to
the  list. YAM recognizes over 20 filetypes automatically and will fill in
the field 'MIME type' accordingly.

Pack & add
By  adding  files  this way they will be archived (LHA, LZX or ZIP) before
being attached to the message. Select the files you would like to be added
to the archive, then enter an archive name. You can define the archiver in
the configuration window under @{"Miscellaneous" LINK "CO14" 0}.

Delete
Removes the selected entries from the list.

Display
Displays  the  selected  entry  using one of the programs contained in the
MIME-viewer list. The default program is MultiView.

Encoding
For  normal  use  you should encode your files using MIME (base64/qp). YAM
uses  quoted-printable  for text files and base64 for binary files. If the
recipient  isn't  able  to  decode  messages  in  MIME format (because his
e-mailer  does not support this) you can also UUencode the files. Messages
containing  UUencoded  files  are still in MIME multipart/mixed format but
can be stripped from the message using a UUdecoder such as UUxt. A message
generated  by YAM may contain UUencoded attachments as well as attachments
in base64 format.

MIME type
As  long as YAM recognizes the filetype of the attachment the correct MIME
type  will  be  inserted  automatically.  Otherwise  the  default  setting
(application/octet-stream)  will  be used. Before defining a new MIME type
please check if it's not already part of the pop-up list.

  Example:  image/gif

Description
You  may  enter  a  comment  on  the  actual  attachment  here.  When more
attachments are added the description - if there is one - will be copied.

  Example:  Picture from our summer holidays (GIF format)

Header fields

Copies to
The  recipients listed here will receive a copy of the actual message. See
also information about the 'To' header given for the @{"Message sheet" LINK "WR00" 0}.

Hidden copies to
The  recipients  listed  here  will  receive a copy of the actual message.
Unlike  the  recipients  listed in 'Copies to' they won't be listed in the
message  header.  This  is  useful if you want to send someone a copy of a
message without the other recipient(s) knowing.

From
Pretty  obvious,  really! YAM will fill this in with your address, but you
can change the way your real name appears (the string in double quotes).

Reply to
This  setting  is  valid  only for the actual message and will be inserted
instead  of  the  normal  reply-to  address  as  specified  in the program
settings.  Leave this blank unless it is different from the e-mail address
in the From header.

Additional header
If  for  any  reason it should become necessary to add one or more special
header  lines to a message you can enter these here. Several lines must be
separated by inserting '\\n'.

Send options

Delete after sending
Activate  this  option  if  you want the message to be deleted right after
transfer instead of being copied to the 'Sent' folder.

Return receipt
By  activating  this  option you ask the recipient's mail server to inform
you  of  the successful mail transfer. Normally you'll only be notified if
problems have occurred. Please note that not all mail servers support this
function.  The  command  to  notify you is sent in the 'Return-Receipt-To'
header field.

Track message
Activate  this  option to ask the recipient's e-mail program to inform you
about  the condition of your message, stating if the message has been read
by  the  recipient or if the recipient has deleted or forwarded it. Please
note  there  are  only  few e-mail programs which support this function as
well  as  the  fact  that  the  recipient is able to forbid the sending of
status  reports  on e-mails. So not getting any information even with this
option  in  force does not necessarily mean the message has not been read.
The   command   to   send   a   status   report   is   contained   in  the
'Disposition-Notification-To'  header  field.  At  the time of writing the
internet  standard  for  Message Disposition Notifications (MDN) was still
being formulated.

Add personalinfo
Check  this  option  to create special message headers containing personal
data  like  your  postal address, phone number, homepage, date of birth or
URL  of your picture. If the recipient works with YAM too, (s)he will able
to  create  an  address book entry and fill it with your data. To get this
working,  add an entry in your address book containing your data (YAM will
find  your  entry based on the e-mail address). If existing, enter the WWW
address  of  a  small  photo  of  you in the "address book" section of the
configuration.

Importance
Specify here how important the message is for the recipient. Messages with
a  high  grade of importance will be displayed with an exclamation mark in
the  status  line  and  will  be  put  into  first place by automatic mail
sorting. The importance will be stated in the 'Importance' header field.

Signature
Here  you  can  replace  the  standard signature by one of the alternative
signatures or switch it off completely.

Security
Select here which security measures you want to take for this message.

             none: Normal mail transfer.
             sign: The message will be signed with your PGP key and saved
                   in multipart/signed format. The text of the message will
                   be readable without PGP.
          encrypt: The message will be encrypted using the recipient's PGP
                   key and saved in multipart/encrypted format.
 sign and encrypt: This is a combination of the two previous options
                   allowing the recipient to check the sender's identity.
 send anonymously: The mail will be sent using an ANON service so the
                   sender will stay anonymous.

Please  note  that encrypted or signed messages must not have binary files
attached. You can find further information in the chapter...

Use  this to attach your @{"public PGP key" LINK "PGP" 0} to your message. The recipient can
add  this  to  his  "keyring"  and will then be able in future to send you
PGP-encoded messages.

@NODE "EDIT" "Editor features"

THE INTERNAL EDITOR

YAM  uses the efficient MUI-Class TextEditor.mcc of messages. Many aspects
of the editor such as key bindings, spell checking or fonts can be changed
in  the  'TextEditor'  sheet  of  the  @{"MUI-configuration" LINK "MAM4" 0}. Although you can
modify the key bindings, here is a list of the important default settings:

        <Control-Up>         go to the start of the text
        <Control-Down>       go to the end of the text
        <Control-Left>       go to the start of the line
        <Control-Right>      go to the end of the line
        <Alt-Up>             previous page
        <Alt-Down>           next page
        <Alt-Left>           previous word
        <Alt-Right>          next word

@NODE "DI_W" "The Glossary"

THE GLOSSARY

YAM's Glossary acts as a place to collect blocks of text which you may use
fairly  frequently,  such  as  templates  for letters, greeting phrases or
frequently  asked  questions.  The  text can be as long as desired and can
extend  over several lines. Using the menu item 'Edit/glossary' or the key
combination  <RAmiga-D>  you can go straight from the @{"internal editor" LINK "EDIT" 0} into
the  glossary.  Each  entry  has  a name (e.g. "ys" for "Yours sincerely")
which  you  can see in the left-hand part of the window. Click on the name
and  you can edit the entry in the right-hand side of the window. A double
click on the name pastes the text block at the current cursor position and
closes the window.

Functions of the buttons:

[New]
Starts a new entry in the glossary.

[Add selection]
Creates  a  new entry in the glossary based on the marked text in the text
editor.

[Delete]
Deletes the selected entry in the glossary.

[Paste]
Pastes  the  highlighted  entry into the text editor at the current cursor
position.

 `-------------------------------------------------------------'

Message status
At the top right corner there is a small field in which small icons
appear to display the @{"status" LINK "MA0S" 0} of the message (new, read etc.).

Headers
The  amount  of  information  displayed  in  the  list  of @{"headers" LINK "HEAD" 0} for the
selected   message  is  set  in  the  @{"configuration" LINK "CO04" 0}  but  can  be  changed
(temporarily)  with  the  @{"Settings" LINK "REM4" 0}  menu.  If you want to copy some of the
lines  to  the  clipboard,  click and drag with the mouse to highlight the
lines. The copy action is automatic and the highlighting disappears.

Message body
The  largest  field displays the message body. Only text can be shown; for
graphics or sounds you must use an @{"external program" LINK "CO04" 0}. Navigation within the
message  uses  the  same  keyboard  shortcuts  as  the @{"internal editor" LINK "EDIT" 0}. In
addition  you can hit the spacebar to go forwards one page and <backspace>
to  go  back to the previous page. To copy part of the part of the message
to the clipboard, click and drag with the mouse to highlight the text. The
copy   action  is  automatic  and  the  highlighting  disappears.  If  you
doubleclick  on  an  e-mail  address,  a  new 'write' window opens and the
address  is  pasted  into  the 'To' header. A doubleclick on a URL, either
http://  or  ftp://, starts the macro defined in the @{"Scripts configuration" LINK "CO13" 0}
with  the  URL  as  parameter (if openurl.library is installed, it will be
used  in  place  of  the macro). In this way you can copy WWW-addresses to
your web browser without fuss.

@NODE "REM1" "Read window - Message Menu"
@TOC "RE_W"

Read window - MESSAGE MENU

Message/Edit
Sends the current message to the message editor.

Message/Move
Moves the current message to a different folder.

Message/Copy
Creates  a  copy  of  the  current  message  in  another  folder. With the
exception of the filename the copy is identical with the original.

Message/Delete
Deletes  the  current message and loads the next one into the read window.
Unless  the option 'remove messages immediately' is enabled (@{"Miscellaneous" LINK "CO14" 0}
configuration  settings), the message is actually moved into the "Deleted"
folder,  from which it can be recovered if need be. The <Del> key works as
a  keyboard  shortcut,  while  <Shift-Del> forces immediate (irreversible)
deletion, regardless of the configuration settings.

Message/Print
Sends  the  actual  message,  or a part of it, to the printer. A requester
opens  to  let  you  choose  whether to print the original message without
decoding  (raw  format),  or  to print the decoded text as diplayed, or to
print  an  attached text file. Note that you cannot print binary data such
as  graphics;  for  that  you must use the print option of the appropriate
(@{"MIME viewer" LINK "CO11" 0}).

Message/Save
Saves  the current message or a part of it to your hard disk, floppy, etc.
Again a requester appears to let you choose whether to save the message in
raw  format,  the  decoded  message  (the  same  as it appears in the read
window), or to save one of the attached files.

Message/Attachments »  Display
This  displays  the  current message, or part of it, using the MIME viewer
specified in the @{"MIME configuration" LINK "CO11" 0}. You can choose whether to display the
message in raw format (to check for errors) or to view one of the attached
files.  If  nothing  happens,  check  the settings for MIME viewers in the
configuration.

Message/Attachments »  Save all
Saves  all  the  files  attached to the current message to a directory you
select.

Message/Attachments »  Crop
Deletes  all  the  attached files for the current message in order to save
disk  space.  Note - these files are not sent to the deleted folder, so be
sure  that  you  don't  want  to  keep  one! This function only applies to
messages in @{"MIME format" LINK "MIME" 0}. A notice is added to the end of the message about
the removed files.

Message/New
Opens the @{"Write window" LINK "WR_W" 0} so you can compose a new message.

Message/Reply
Use this to reply to the current message. Subject and recipient fields are
filled in automatically and the original message is quoted.

Message/Forward
Use  this to forward the contents of the message to another recipient. The
subject  and  the  message body are automatically copied and a new message
header   is  created.  The  text  for  forwarding  defined  in  the  @{"Reply" LINK "CO06" 0}
configuration is inserted at the start of the message.

Message/Bounce
Use  this to send the original unaltered message to another recipient. The
only  changes made are to enter a new To header while YAM adds a couple of
Resent  headers  (based on the original To header). The text for forwarded
messages (as defined in the configuration) is not used.

Message/Save address
The  address  of  the  sender  (or the recipient, depending on the type of
folder)  of  the  current  message  is  put into your @{"Address book." LINK "AB_W" 0}. If the
message  has  multiple  recipients,  you  have  the  option  of creating a
distribution list.

Message/Change subject
This  lets you change the subject of the current message, so you can amend
uninformative  subject  headers  subsequent  to receiving the message. The
original  subject  is saved in an X-Original-Subject header, to facilitate
following a thread back.

Navigation/next message
This  displays  the next message i.e. the one below the current message in
the main window. Shortcut: <cursor right>

Navigation/previous message
This  displays the previous message i.e. the one above the current message
in the main window. Shortcut: <cursor left>

Navigation/next unread message
This  displays  the  next unread message i.e. below the current message in
the main window. If there are no  more  new  messages  below  the  current
message  in  the  current  folder but in one of the following folders, you
will be notified about this and asked if you want to change to  the  given
folder and continue reading there. Shortcut: <Shift-cursor right>

Navigation/previous unread message
This displays the previous unread message i.e. above the  current  message
in  the  main  window. If there are no more new messages above the current
message in the current folder but in one of the previous folders, you will
be notified about this and asked if you want to change to the given folder
and continue reading there. Shortcut: <Shift-cursor left>

Navigation/next message in thread
This  displays  the  message  which  replies  to the current message. This
allows  you  to  follow  a  dialogue  between yourself and another person,
regardless  of  what  other  messages are present in the folders. But note
that  to  find  the  reply  in a different folder, YAM must load the index
filesvfor  all  the  folders,  which  can  take  a while. YAM compares the
@{"message-ID" LINK "HEAD" 0}  header  of  the current message with the In-Reply-To header of
the  other  message.  Should  the  answer not be found, the screen flashes
briefly.

Navigation/previous message in thread
Loads  the  message  to  which  the  current  message is a reply (see item
above!).

PGP/extract public key
If  the  sender of the current message has attached his @{"public PGP key" LINK "PGP" 0} you
can  transfer  this  to  your "key ring". You can then use this key if the
sender then sends you an encrypted message.

PGP/check PGP signature
Verifies  the  signature  of the current message. This works only with PGP
signed  messages  and  serves  to  ensure  that  the  message has not been
tampered with and is really from the named sender.

PGP/save decrypted message
On  the  grounds  of security a @{"PGP-encrypted" LINK "PGP" 0} message is saved to the hard
disk  as  it stands. To open it you have to use the key each time. You can
use  this  menu  item  to  save  the  decrypted  message to the hard disk,
overwriting the PGP-encrypted version.

@ENDNODE

Read window - SETTINGS MENU

These  choices  only  apply  to the current session; on opening a new read
window the @{"Read" LINK "CO04" 0} configuration settings are used.

Settings/no  headers|short  headers|full  headers
Use these to select how much of the information in the headers you want to
see  in  the read window. This choice only applies to the current session;
on opening a new read window the @{"Read" LINK "CO04" 0} configuration settings are used.

Settings/no sender info|data fields only|data and image
This  selects how much of the information saved in your @{"address book" LINK "AB_W" 0} about
the  sender  is  to  be displayed. This choice only applies to the current
session;  on opening a new read window the @{"Read configuration" LINK "CO04" 0} settings are
used.

Settings/wrap headers
Choose whether to show a long header on one line or to break it across
two or more.  In the first case you will need to use the horizontal
scrollbar in order to see all of the information.

Settings/text styles
YAM  uses  the characters _ / * and # to indicate underlined, italic, bold
and coloured text. For certain special documents (like Quelltext) this can
make  things difficult because some characters are suppressed. So you have
the option of switching the rendering of text styles on or off.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "TR_W" "Mail Transfers"

MAIL TRANSFERS

When  fetching,  sending, importing or exporting mail YAM opens a transfer
window which allows you some control over the process.

If  pre-selection  is enabled YAM displays a list of the messages on offer
for  importing  or  downloading. Messages which exceed the pre-set maximum
size  are  highlighted  with white letters. Two explanatory status symbols
may  show  at  the  side  of the message. A little trashcan means that the
message  will  be  deleted from the server. The floppy disk icon indicates
that  the  message  will  be downloaded. There are therefore the following
possibilities:

  Trashcan   Diskette  Action
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   yes        yes      The message will be downloaded and then deleted
                       from the server
   yes        no       The message is deleted immediately! The preferred
                       action for unsolicited commercial e-mail.
   no         no       The message remains on the server but is not
                       downloaded.
   no         yes      The message is downloaded but not deleted.

Meanings of the buttons:

All
Selects  all  messages in the list for a subsequent change of status. This
button has no effect on the action to be taken.

None
Clears  the  current selection. This button has no effect on the action to
be taken.

Download & delete
Sets  both  the  diskette  and trashcan icons for all selected messages ->
download and remove on server.

Download only
Sets  the  diskette  icon  and  clears  the trashcan icon for all selected
messages -> download, but leave on server.

Leave
Clears  both  the diskette and trashcan icons for all selected messages ->
no action.

Delete only
Clears  the  diskette  icon  and  sets  the trashcan icon for all selected
messages -> do not download, but delete on server!

Stop/proceed
So  long  as the pre-selection list is displayed, YAM loads details of the
separate  messages  -  the  headers are called from the server. The [Stop]
button halts this process.

Start
The selection stage is ended and the mail transfer starts.

Abort
The mail transfer is terminated immediately.

In  the  panel  'Status' you can see how many kbytes and how many messages
have been transferred so far, at what rate, and how long the transfer will
take.   The  rate  is  measured  in  characters  per  second.  Do  not  be
disappointed  if  the transmission seems not to measure up to the speed of
the  modem.  The  transfer  of a short message requires a relatively large
time  for negotiation between YAM and the server, which is not allowed for
in the calculated rate. Try it yourself and send yourself a message with a
large attachment (e.g. 100kb).

The  [Abort]  button forces a premature end to the transfer. It only works
if  YAM  has control of the transfer. If YAM freezes because the server is
not  doing  anything,  either  wait  for  the  time-out  or else break the
connection by means of the TCP/IP program.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "US_W" "Users"

USER ADMINISTRATION

YAM  will  satisfy the needs of a large family, being able to handle up to
16  users, who can each have their own folders and configuration settings.
On  starting  YAM you can say who you are and immediately get back to your
own  personal  set-up.  Thus  programs  like  MultiYAM  become  redundant.
Selecting the menu item Settings/Users brings you to the Users window.

User name
This  is  the  name  of  the  user.  It appears in the Welcome dialogue on
starting up the program, so long as only a single user is defined.

  Example:  Bill Brown

Password
If  you  fill  in  this  field, then a password requester appears when you
select this user on program startup.

Mail directory
This  is  the  home directory for all user-specific files, such as folders
and  configuration  settings.  This  directory obviously must be different
from that of any other user.

  Example:  YAM:bill

[] Use global address book
Check  this  option  if the user will not use a personal address book. The
address  book is then shared with the other users; the file is kept in the
program base directory and not in the user's home directory.

[] Use global glossary
Enable  this  option if the user will not maintain a separate glossary but
rather  share  one  with  the other users. The file is kept in the program
base directory and not in the users home directory.

[] Supervisor privileges
Enable this option to allow the user to create or remove other users.

[] Copy configuration from current user
If  you  are  adding  a  new user, you can select this option and copy the
current  settings  to  the new user directory, so saving the new user some
tedious work setting up a configuration from scratch.

[Add user]          Adds a new user to the list

[Delete user]       Deletes the selected user from the list.

@NODE "OPTI" "Startup options"

STARTUP OPTIONS

YAM  supports  some  special startup options, which can be used from Shell
and from the Workbench (Tooltypes).

USER=user name
Selects  the  active  YAM  user.  So  you  can skip the login procedure on
startup in case you've created multiple users.

PASSWORD=password
This is the password for the selected user (see above). It serves to avoid
the password request on program startup.

MAILDIR=path
Sets  the  root  directory for the folders and configuration files. In YAM
1.3.x  this  option was used to implement multi-user support. YAM 2.x sets
the root directory for each user in the user configuration.

PREFSFILE=filename
Configuration file what should be used. Default is <MAILDIR>/.config

HIDE
Starts YAM in iconified mode.

NOCHECK
Skips  the  feature 'Send/Get mail on startup' and 'Check birthdays' (this
might be useful if you're starting YAM from a WWW browser).

DEBUG
This  option protocols the conversation between YAM and the mail server in
the Shell window. It's a very valuable tool if the connection fails.

MAILTO=address
Creates a new message for the specified recipient on startup.

SUBJECT=subject
Sets the subject for the new message (see MAILTO).

LETTER=text file
The text file contains the letter you want to send (see MAILTO).

ATTACH=files
Attaches one or more files to the new message (see MAILTO).

  Examples:

    YAM USER Tom PASSWORD secret HIDE
    YAM NOCHECK MAILTO mbeck\@access.ch SUBJECT "Bug Report"
        ATTACH ram:debug.txt

@ENDNODE
@NODE "REXX" "ARexx Interface"

AREXX INTERFACE

With  the help of ARexx scripts you can add new functions to YAM or let it
do things automatically. YAM offers a @{"set of commands" LINK "REXL" 0}, which can be called
through the ARexx port "YAM".

Explanations for the syntax templates of the @{"ARexx commands" LINK "REXL" 0}:

  /A   The parameter is compulsory
  /K   The parameter must be preceeded by the keyword
  /N   Numerical argument or result
  /M   Argument or result is a list of null or more elements

Take care when passing arguments that contain spaces:

  sub = 'Hello World'
  'WRITESUBJECT' sub
  doesn't work! It must be written as:
  'WRITESUBJECT "'sub'"'   or
  'WRITESUBJECT "Hello World"'

Commands  can return results in three different kinds. Let's look at these
examples which use the FOLDERINFO command:

  FOLDERINFO
    -> RESULT = "0 Incoming incoming 10 2 4 23030 1"

  FOLDERINFO VAR fi
    -> fi = "0 Incoming incoming 10 2 4 23030 1"

  FOLDERINFO STEM fi.
    -> fi.number = 0
       fi.name = "Incoming"
       fi.path = "incoming"
       fi.total = 10
       fi.new = 2
       fi.unread = 4
       fi.size = 23030
       fi.type = 1

Another example which returns a result of type /M:

  ADDRFIND STEM found. "Marcel Beck" SEARCHNAME
    -> found.alias.count = 2
       found.alias.0 = "Mars"
       found.alias.1 = "mbe"

WHAT IS ELECTRONIC MAIL?

E-mail  was  the  first  service  to be implemented on the Internet and is
still  the  most  popular  method  of  communication  over the Internet. A
substantial  proportion  of  the  people  on  the  internet  use only this
service.  It  is  predicted that in the next few years e-mail will replace
the  traditional  forms  of  communication  like  letters and fax for many
purposes. At the present time one can in a matter of minutes reach several
million  people  world-wide  by  e-mail.  Users of other networks, such as
Compuserve and T-Online are connected to the internet through "gateways".

@NODE "HEAD" "Make up of a message header"

MAKE UP OF A MESSAGE HEADER

Every  e-mail  starts  with  a  header  which is separated from the actual
message  body  by  a  blank line. YAM constructs this header automatically
following the settings specified in the Configuration.

The  header  of an e-mail is divided into fields which each start on a new
line and have the general form 'Fieldname: contents'. Fields which are too
long  for  a  single  line  can  be  split  to run over several lines. The
majority  of  the header lines can be omitted but are added to provide the
recipient's  mail program with additional information about the message or
to give data needed to check for errors caused by transmission problems. A
few  of  the  important  fields  are  explained  by means of the following
example.

  Return-Path: <just\@zfn.uni-bremen.de>

This  field is added by the recipient's mailserver and contains the e-mail
address of the sender to allow the recipient's computer to send a reply by
e-mail

  Received: from ina.zfn.uni-bremen.de by atlantica.access.ch
            (8.8.5/INA-1.05pri) id XAA29100;
            Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:40:45 +0100 (MET)
  Received: from moritz37.zfn.uni-bremen.de by
            ina.zfn.uni-bremen.de (AIX 3.2/UCB 5.64/ZFNserver) id AA26355;
            Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:40:13 +0100

Each  computer  which  sends the message on the next stage of its journey,
and  also  the  recipient's  own  system,  adds on a Received field to the
header to say when the message arrived and where it came from. This allows
one  to  reconstruct  transmission  problems  which  may have affected the
message along its route.

  From: Christian Just <just\@zfn.uni-bremen.de>

E-mail address and real name of the sender.

  Reply-To: just\@zfn.uni-bremen.de

The  address  to  which  any reply to this message should be sent. This is
used  if the message is despatched from a computer which the sender cannot
use  to  read mail, for whatever reason. Then he can use this field to say
where  a reply should be sent. In the absence of a Reply-To field, replies
go the address given in the From field.

  To: "Marcel Beck (Yet another Mailer-autor)" <mbeck\@access.ch>

The  address of the recipient; additional names can be given, separated by
commas. This field may contain simply the address in the form name\@domain
or  else  it  may  be  prefaced  by  an  additional  comment,  such as the
recipient's  name.  In  this  case the address must be enclosed in pointed
brackets.

  Date: Tue, 23 Dec 1997 23:28:30 +0200

Date  and  time  of  despatch  of  the  message. The figure after the time
represents  the time zone, expressed as the difference from Greenwich Mean
Time.  In  this,  the first two digits show the hours and the next two the
minutes.

  Message-Id: <YAM7296.1549.122414920\@zfn.uni-bremen.de>

A  unique  identifier, created automatically on despatch. Using this it is
possible unequivocally to cancel any particular message.

  In-Reply-To: <YAM7296.263.121102896\@mail.access.ch>

A precise reference to message being replied to, such as its message-ID

  X-Mailer: YAM 2.0beta4 - Amiga Mailer by Marcel Beck - http://www.YAM.ch

Name and Version of the sender's mail program.

  Subject: Re: YAM2beta5

This field should state concisely the topic of the message. Giving a clear
and informative Subject is a mark of good style ("Netiquette").

 Mime-Version: 1.0
 Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

These  fields indicate that the message is set out in MIME format. In this
example,  it  contains  plain  text  in  the ISO-Latin-1 character set and
characters  which  cannot  be  represented  using  7  bits  are  coded  as
Quoted-printable.

ENCRYPTING WITH PGP

In order to ensure that the e-mail cannot be read by anyone other than the
recipient, it is necessary to encrypt the transmission. Is this important?
Sometimes  very  much  so! It is not possible to say in advance what route
electronic mail will take through the Net and along the way it is possible
or  someone  to  read your mail unauthorised, admittedly with more trouble
than  one  would normally bother to take. In particular, encrypting e-mail
is a wise precaution if you want to send passwords, credit card numbers or
suchlike  over the Net. Such encrypted data is then often transmitted more
safely  than if sent by normal letter post. A simple, effective and widely
used  tool  for  this  sort  of  encryption  is PGP, short for Pretty Good
Privacy.

It  was  developed  by  Phil Zimmermann and employs the public key method.
Using  this  PGP  program  one  can  be  sure  that the message is the one
actually  written  by  the sender and that only the intended recipient can
read  it.  So-called  public  keys  offer  the  highest  possible level of
security.

There are two kinds of key:

 - One is a private key, used on your computer and never revealed
   elsewhere.
 - The other sort is the public key.  You can make as many copies of this
   as you like, and send  the copies to other users so that they can send
   you encrypted  mail.

You  need  both  types  of  key,  public  and  private,  because  they are
inherently connected together. You can distribute your public key as often
as  needed  but  it  will  only  work  when  matched  up  with  its  exact
counterpart.  Hence  both  public and private keys are involved in locking
and  (generally)  unlocking information. PGP keys are used in two distinct
ways:

 1. Another person can encrypt information using your public key and send
    the encrypted file to you, to decipher with your private key.
 2. You can encrypt information with your private  key and send it safely
    over the Net.  Anyone in possession of your public  key can read your
    communication.  The recipient can be sure that the  communication  is
    genuinely from you  (your  digital signature proves its authenticity)
    and that it has not been altered.

PGP  is obtainable as freeware and the International PGP Home Page is easy
to find on the Internet at: http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/

@ENDNODE
@NODE "PROT" "Basics - Mail Protocols"
@TOC "MAIL"

MAIL PROTOCOLS

YAM  uses  the  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) in order to send your
mail to the SMTP server, which also uses SMTP to transmit your mail across
the  whole world. Incoming mail arrives at your Post Office Protocol (POP)
server,  where it waits until YAM downloads it to your computer, using the
POP3  (version  3)  protocols.  The  messages which YAM sends and receives
conform to the conventions set out in RFC 822 and RFC 1521 (MIME).

Outgoing mail

If you want to send an e-mail message to anyone, YAM transfers the message
by  SMTP  to your local SMTP server. This computer forwards the message to
the recipient's computer, generally also by SMTP.

Why  does  YAM  not deal directly with the recipient's server? Firstly, it
would  take  quite  a  long time for your Amiga to get a connection to one
particular   computer  and  then  transmit  the  message.  Secondly,  many
computers  are hard to find; it is much better to let the mail server look
for   the  address,  instead  of  burdening  your  Amiga.  Thirdly,  quite
frequently  the  recipient's  server will not be available at the time you
want to send the mail. The SMTP server solves these problems, holding back
the message until the other computer is ready to receive it.

Incoming mail

If  someone sends you mail, the other computer transfers it using the SMTP
protocol  as  far as your POP server. This stores the message in a sort of
mailbox,  where  it  remains  until YAM collects it. When you look for new
mail, YAM downloads the message to your Amiga using POP3.

Why  doesn't YAM use SMTP for incoming mail? SMTP works best if the if the
intercommunicating  computers  both  are  on  standby to receive messages.
Unless  you  run  YAM and your Amiga 24 hours a day and seven days a week,
SMTP would not be particularly suitable for you.

@TOC "MAIL"

WHAT IS MIME?

MIME  stands  for  Multipurpose  Internet Mail Extensions. MIME serves two
major  purposes:  it allows one mail application to tell another what sort
of  data is contained in a message and it also provides standardised rules
by which mail applications can encode data, so that it can be sent through
the Internet mail system.

MIME Encoding

The  Internet  uses the SMTP protocol to move mail around. SMTP is limited
to  the  US-ASCII  character  set.  This is a problem for people who speak
languages  other  than American English and so need accented characters or
non-American  letters,  or for people who want to use special symbols like
the  bullet.  Even  more difficult is the transmission of binary files (as
attached  files).  MIME  provides a way around this restriction. It offers
two encodings, "quoted- printable" and "base64".

These encodings use US-ASCII character codes to represent any sort of data
you   like,   including   special   characters   or  even  non-text  data.
Quoted-printable  is  used  for  data that is mostly text, but has special
characters for very long lines.

Quoted-printable  looks  just  like  regular  text,  except when a special
character  is  used.  The  special character is replaced with an = and two
more  characters  that  represent  the (hexadecimal) character code of the
special  character.  So, a bullet in quoted-printable looks like =95DA. No
line in quoted-printable is allowed to be more than 76 characters long. If
your  mail  has  a  line  longer  than 76 characters, the quoted-printable
encoding will break your line in two, and put an = at the end of the first
line, to signal to the mail reader at the other end that the two lines are
really supposed to be one.

Base64  encoding  is another way to protect binary data from the SMTP mail
system.  However,  Base64  makes  no  attempt  to be legible, and is, most
appropriate  for non-text data. It is equivalent to the older UUencode but
more reliable in use.

Content type

The  other  important  function  of  MIME  is  to  allows mail programs to
exchange information about what kind of data is in a message (or part of a
message).  The primary mechanism used for this is the Content-Type header.
The major content types are:

   text        readable text
   image       pictures and graphics
   audio       sound
   video       animations
   message     messages or parts of messages
   multipart   several different kinds of data in a single message

The subtype gives additional information about the type of data:

   text/plain   plain text
   text/html    text in HTML format
   image/gif    image in GIF format
   etc.

By  using  the  Content  type a mail program is able to select the correct
utility to display the attached file.

@NODE "DOSW" "AmigaDOS Patterns and wildcards"

AMIGADOS PATTERN MATCHING

The  use  of  wildcards  in  patterns  allows  you to set up very powerful
searches. The special wildcard characters are listed below.

  ?   Matches any single character
      so Y?M matches YAM, YUM, Y\@M etc.

  #   Matches zero or more occurrences of the following item
      so Y#AM matches YM, YAM, YAAM, YAAAM etc.

  #?  matches anything at all (including nothing!)
      so #?YAM#? matches any string containing "YAM"

  %   matches an empty string.  Not terribly useful by itself, but you
      could use it to find messages with blank Subject headers.

  ()  Round brackets are used to group characters and expressions and show
      how to evaluate the expression.  Use them freely!
      Thus #(Re:)YAM matches YAM, Re:YAM, Re:Re:YAM ...

  []  Square brackets are used to indicate a list of alternatives
      so [YAM] matches any of the single letters Y, A or M but not  YAM

  -   indicates a range, so [0-9] matches any single digit
      and #[0-9] matches any integral number.

  ~   means NOT, referring to the whole expression following,
      so ~Re: matches any  string that does not start with "Re:"

  |   means OR, referring to the expressions either side. You have  to
      enclose the whole expression in round brackets:
      e.g.  (#?YAM#?|#?MUI#?) finds strings including either "YAM" or
      "MUI".

WARNING!  It's  not  as  easy  as it looks! For example, let's construct a
filter that will find references to YAM or YAM2 but discard YAM1. Try this
one: #?YAM(~1)

What does this say to do? Reading a new string from the left, look for the
sequence  YAM.  If you find it, look at the following part: is it equal to
"1"?  If  not,  you've got a match. The trouble is, "1.3.5" isn't equal to
"1"  (it's  too  long)  so YAM1.3.5 is included when we don't want it. The
solution is to make it clear that the string following "YAM" mustn't start
with a "1". So try: #?YAM(~1#?)

This  gets  rid  of  1.3.5 alright, but there's still a problem. Sometimes
people  insert  a  space  between YAM and the version number and sometimes
not.  So  references  to YAM 1 are still included. So we must say that any
number of spaces may be present, like this: #?YAM# (~1#?)

Another  case  -  suppose we want to find all the strings that include YAM
but do not start with "Re:". So we try: (~Re:)YAM#?

This  says  to  begin by comparing the start of the string to "Re:". If we
get  a match, that string is discarded. If not, we look in the rest of the
string to find "YAM". So what happens if the string starts with "YAM"? The
first  letter  isn't  R, so the NOT condition is satisfied. But we've done
the  Y  now, so we don't find the string YAM! To sort this out, we have to
explain  that  the  string  in  front  of "YAM" may be the null string (so
that's what it's for!) Like this: (~Re:|%)YAM#?

  Question for computer buffs: what does ~((~#?YAM#?)|(~#?MUI#?)) mean?

@NODE "NETI" "The basics - eMAIL Netiquette"
@TOC "MAIL"

EMAIL NETIQUETTE

Keep messages short and to the point.

Give  the  message a concise and meaningful Subject header, so that it can
easily be found again.

Put  a  signature at the end of the message. This should contain your name
and  e-mail  address  and should not be longer than five lines. Signatures
often  also  give  the  postal  address,  telephone  number,  web-site and
instructions about sending PGP messages.

Only  write in block capitals if you want to give particular emphasis to a
point.  *Stars*  are  also used for emphasis (YAM interprets this by using
bold type).

Block capitals are generally taken as equivalent to SHOUTING.

Set  up  YAM to use a line length of less than 80 characters and don't use
any control characters.

Don't  use  non-ASCII  characters unless you are sure that the recipient's
software interprets them correctly.

It  is  regarded  as  extremely impolite to forward a private message to a
mailing list without the permission of the original sender.

Abbreviations  and  TLA's  (Three  Letter Acronyms) can be useful provided
they don't make the message unintelligible. The following are often used:

                    IMHO   (in my humble opinion)
                    BTW    (by the way)
                    FYI    (for your information)
                    AFAIK  (as far as I know)
                    ASAP   (as soon as possible)
                    CU     (see you)

Use  the  ;-)  smiley  (winky?)  to  denote  a  touch of irony which could
otherwise easily be misinterpreted.

Be  tolerant  of  other  people's  failings,  e.g.  in  spelling, grammar,
expression or familiarity with e-mail.

If  you  join  a mailing list, read the messages for a while to get a feel
for the general style, what questions are asked and what is not suitable.

Study  the FAQ's (lists of Frequently Asked Questions). It is annoying for
the members of a group if the same questions are being asked repeatedly.

If  someone  posts a message which is "off-topic", i.e. does not belong in
the mailing list, reply privately and not in the list.

If you quote another message, then cut all the bits which are not relevant
to your answer. No-one wants to read the same message three or four times,
especially when all that is added is "Yes, me too".

Resist  the  temptation  to  flame  in  the mailing list. ("Flame" = write
abusively,  generally  when provoked by idiocy.) Remember that the list is
public and meant for constructive discussion. Do as you would be done by!

If  you  reply  to  a  message in a mailing list, think whether to send it
direct  to  the  sender  or  to  the list and check that the To address is
correct. It can be very irritating when a letter addressed to a particular
person appears on the list, unintentionally.
