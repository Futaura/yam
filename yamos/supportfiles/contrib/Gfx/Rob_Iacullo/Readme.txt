These icons are for OS 3.5.  I don't know if they will work with previous
versions.

Installation:

You may want to backup the old ones first.

Copy Miami.info and MiamiOnline.info to the Miami directory.

You may have to open Miami, click on "GUI" and select Miami.info
as your Offline icon, and MiamiOnline.info as your Onine icon.

Right click on settings and save as default.

The offline icon will have a dark sky and the online icon will have
sunny sky.


Copy the rest of the icons to Yam:icons.

For an empty incoming folder the envelope is closed.  For old mail
the envelope is open.  To indicate new mail the envelope is open
and glowing.  To indicate you should check the mail the envelope
is open and there is a magnifying glass over it.


The Yam icons were made from the mail icon that came with the OS 3.5
upgrade cd.

I believe that the icons for Miami originated from the GlowIcons 1 set.


I guess that covers it.  If you think there should be additional info
let me know.  Also, if you have any feedback about the icons let me know.
