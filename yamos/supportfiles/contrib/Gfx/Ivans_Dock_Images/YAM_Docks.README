These are 14 docks I made up for YAM one late night when I had nothing
better to do. Hope you like 'em. Sorry there are no docks useing the
New Icons palette, I don't run it on my machine. But if there is enough
interest I'll install NI and make them for you.

Send any compliments, flames, personal nudie pics to ivan@mnsi.net
