Introduction
============

This is a very incomplete draft of a guide for new members of the
YAMOS team, as well as people who just want to compile YAM.


How to compile YAM from a clean SAS/C 6.58 installation
=======================================================

First download 'dev/mui/mui38dev.lha' from Aminet and install the
includes.

YAM uses a custom tool to generate header files for some of the MUI
classes. Before compiling YAM you must compile this tool:

 smake GenClasses

and create the needed header files (you also need to do this from time
to time when the classes are updated):

 smake ClassInfo


Rules
=====

- Parts of YAM are being rewritten to achieve a more modular, object-
  oriented design; during this transition, two different styles are used
  throughout the project. In the "classes" directory you'll find the new
  sources. Read the "StyleGuide.ReadMe" file before making changes to
  these files or adding new classes - especially the paragraph about tabs.

  Remember:  Follow the style! The old sources use a tab setting of 3, but
  you must use spaces instead of real tabs. Follow the style!

- Before doing any major or questionable change, bring it up on the
  YAMos-dev mailing list. Don't make any change based on personal
  preferences without discussing it first. Remember that you are not the
  only one using YAM, and other developers may disagree with your ideas.
