Various items that ought to be implemented in future YAM releases.

While the initial checkin of this file collects a set of items that were
not previously discussed in the YAMOS mailing list but were picked from
the current list of feature requests, further items should get added here
when it is decided that something needs to be done, and removed when the
folks who asked for the feature/fix have agreed that the feature is in/
problem is fixed, or that the feature is not needed/problem isn't really
a problem (rule borrowed from the Majordomo2 TODO file - /David)



============
New features
============

New message flags
-----------------
An "undeletable" flag is requested. This flag would prevent a message from
being deleted by whatever means within YAM unless a suitable menu item
is invoked to clear the flag. The MAILSTATUS ARexx command should also
be able to set and unset it, of course.


Automation for the usual Start/Quit events
------------------------------------------
These days some folks are running YAM 24/7, so the the old mail deletion
on exit are no longer serving any purpose. A mechanism to trigger this
event on a periodical basis needs to be implemented; the choice to invoke
them with a menu item would also be nice, possibly complete with suitable
ARexx commands.


Security against "disk full" errors
-----------------------------------
If the drive where the mail is stored happens to be full at the time
a message is sent (later), the message is completely lost - the user
has no chance to make some room in the drive and click a [Retry] gadget
as is usually the case in AmigaOS. This needs to be sorted out.


Additional folder-centric settings
----------------------------------
Every folder should be able to have its own appicon on Workbench, but the
appicon would only appear when the folder contains new or unread mail -
double clicking the appicon would automatically (1) uniconify YAM if
appropriate and (2) select that folder. This would make life easier for
users who have a multidrop account whereby they use to get mail addressed
to sales@example.net, info@example.com, support@example.org, etc. but
receive it all in the same mail account - the already existing mailing
list support settings and some suitable filters would take care of
everything else.

Charsets and salutation phrases should work on a per folder basis, too.
In other words, they should be part of the "mailing list support settings",
overriding the defaults set in the configuration.


More complete/friendlier folder list
------------------------------------
Groups ought to list the total size of their contents, either if they
are open or closed.

Selecting a group should NOT disable the mail listview, but leave its
current contents intact until another folder is selected.


Enhanced navigation with the keyboard
-------------------------------------
The MUIA_CycleChain tag is missing for the three tabs in the Filters config
window.
