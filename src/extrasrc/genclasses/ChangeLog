    * gc.c: raised the default warning level to "-pedantic" for GCC
      as we want to make sure it compiles on almost every system with
      every compiler involved. However, the "-Wno-strict-aliasing" is
      required as well or otherwise GCC will warn about some stupid
      strict aliasing.

2005-11-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * gc.c: replaced all 'long' datatype usages against 'int' as they
      where anyway not required and caused quite some problems on
      64bit system. There the hash generation code generated 64bit
      values instead of 32bit ones, which is of course a requirement.
      Also modified the whole tagvalue generation code to just generate
      tag values that are between TAG_USER (0x80000000) and the MUI's
      one (0x80010000) because otherwise we might run into problems.

2005-11-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * gc.c: exported text will now be placed before the generated MUIP
      structures because it may contain type definitions required by
      the MUIP structures.

2004-07-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * replace the va_list/va_start calls with the much more general
      VA_LIST/VA_START macros out of the new SDI_stdarg.h
      compatibility header file.

2004-05-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * removed the special AmigaOS4 ASMSTUB handling again as the 51.4
      kernel of AmigaOS4 seem to handle m68k<>PPC cross calls correctly
      now.

2004-01-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * added AmigaOS4 support. Now the _NewObject() varargs function
      will take respect of the different varargs handling of AmigaOS4.

2002-11-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * gc.c/processclasssrc(): fixed NULL pointer crash
    * gc.c: fixed generated CleanupClasses to deal with NULL classes
    * Makefile, smakefile: simplify

2002-06-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added STDARGS define to _NewObject()
    * added MorphOS support. Now the _NewObject() varargs function
      will take respect of the different vararg handling of MorphOS.

2002-05-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added gcc Makefile

2002-05-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * added a cast to the MUI_CreateCustomClass() call to get rid of the
      portability warnings #120 of SAS/C.

2002-02-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * gc.c/gen_classheaders(): generated headername defaults to <name>_cl.h
      to avoid potenntial name clashes

2001-10-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

    * fixed mass of enforcer hits
    * fixed serious list handling problem where it happened that
      GenClasses were interating out of the list.
