3Pyramids for YAM 2.2
****************

At 3Pyramids everybody can get an eamil-address for free. You can check it 
over the web (http://3pyramids.zzn.com) or with YAM if you are at home.

If you are using it over the web, it gives you lots of features like filters and
several different langauges. If you want to use it with YAM, you have first to
enable the POP3-function on the website and then one day later or so, you
can read your mails also with YAM.

So you have to configure YAM:

First steps:
 Name: "your name"
 Email-Address: "name"@3pyramids.zzn.com
 POP3-Server: apop@zzn.com
 Password: "your password"

TCP/IP
 Server: "information from your provider"
 Domain: "information from your provider"

 POP3-Server: apop@zzn.com
 User-ID: "name"@3pyramids.zzn.com
 Passwrod: "your password"

Writing
 Reply-to-answer: "name"@3pyramids.zzn.com

To make YAM more 3Pyramids-look-like copy the files from the Icons-drawer into 
the Icons-drawer in the YAM-directory.
