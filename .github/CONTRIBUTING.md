# Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. However, please follow the following guidelines when posting a GitHub Pull Request or filing a GitHub Issue on the systemd project:

## Filing Issues

* We use GitHub Issues **exclusively** for tracking **bugs** and **feature** **requests** of YAM. If you are looking for help, please contact our [mailing lists](https://yam.ch/wiki/MailingLists) as well as [online forum](https://yam.ch/discussion/) or [FAQ](https://yam.ch/wiki/FAQ) instead.
* We only track bugs in the **two** **most** **recently** **released** **versions** of YAM in the GitHub Issue tracker.
* When filing an issue, specify the **YAM** **version** you are experiencing the issue with. Also, indicate which **operating system** you are using.
* Please include an explanation how to reproduce the issue you are pointing out.

Following these guidelines makes it easier for us to process your issue, and ensures we won't close your issue right-away for being misfiled.

## Posting Pull Requests

* Make sure to post PRs only relative to a very recent git master.
* Follow our [Coding Style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jens-maus/yam/master/STYLEGUIDE) when contributing code. This is a requirement for all code we merge.
* Please make sure to test your change before submitting the PR.
* If you need to update the code in an existing PR, force-push into the same branch, overriding old commits with new versions.
* After you have pushed a new version, add a comment about the new version (no notification is sent just for the commits, so it's easy to miss the update without an explicit comment).

## Final Words

We'd like to apologize in advance if we are not able to process and reply to your issue or PR right-away. We have a lot of work to do, but we are trying our best!

Thank you very much for your contributions!
