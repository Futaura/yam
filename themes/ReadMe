THEMES IMPLEMENTATION IN YAM 2.5+:

This is the themes directory of YAM 2.5+. Beside a required
"default" directory a user can put an unlimited amount of user
themes within this directory. All of these themes subdirectories
have to have a ".theme" file with META information about the
theme so that YAM is able to identify the directory as a valid
theme and load the images from it during startup.

USER THEMES:
Own themes can be created very easily. You just have to copy
the content of the 'default' theme (except the logo file) to
a new subdirectory. Then you have to modify the ".theme" file
and add your own information/details about the new theme. After
a restart of YAM the new theme should then be available in the
'Look&Feel' configuration of YAM. After that you can replace
every image or icon in the new theme with your own images/icons.

WARNING:
The "default" theme is special. It is the fallback theme of YAM
and should NOT be touched/changed/altered by a user. It must be
in the exact state like it is distributed with YAM. This means
that you should NOT touch anything in the 'default' theme or
even rename it or replace it with your own one! Future YAM
versions will automatically replace the content of the default
theme directory without any notice or warning. So keep it
untouched and if you want to have your own graphics/images, then
create your own theme instead! Also please note that while the
default theme contains a "logo" file, user themes can NOT have
own logo files as the YAM logo should be the same throughout
the different themes/configurations.
