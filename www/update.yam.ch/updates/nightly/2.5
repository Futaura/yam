2007-12-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * YAM.c, YAM_CO.c: minor adaptions to the debug output of the XPK packer
    loading. Also the xpk packer list will only be iterated through in case
    xpk was found at all.

2007-12-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * doc/Install_YAM: some more adaptions for the final install script.
  * YAM_COg.c: not all XPK libraries were added to the packers list because some
    do not offer all flags. But since XPK is basically a packing suite all these
    libs should occur in the list. This fixes bug #1855456.

2007-12-20  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.
  * doc/YAM_english.guide: Updated the software requirements with the recently
    release MUI mcc's and Codesets library.

2007-12-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_COg.c: removed again some HVSpaces where they were not necessary.
  * doc/Install_YAM: removed the YAM: assign from the installer script and the
    british english catalog for OS3/MOS, as these systems cannot handle accents
    of a language.
  * doc/Install_YAM: first modifications for upcoming release of 2.5. Currently
    only english, british english, german, french and swedish are all languages
    still supported. All other languages will be excluded from the release,
    because the catalogs have not been updated since 2.4 or even 2.3. The
    documentation laggs even more behind, but since this is not essential to be
    able to run YAM we leave it as it is for the moment.

2007-12-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * YAM.c: bumped minimum required version of TextEditor.mcc to 15.25 as
    that one is the very latest now.
  * YAM.cd, deutsch.ct, english-british.ct: adapted all toolbar strings to
    not be wider than 8 characters or otherwise the size of the toolbars
    may become to wide for systems with a small screen size. In addition,
    please note, that the strings of the toolbar are just meant to carry
    rough abbreviations of the actions. So translators should keep the
    strings small as well.

2007-12-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * YAM.c: bumped minimum required version for all NList-classes according
    to the version in the v0.101 release.

2007-12-18  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_COg.c: put all config pages on a scroll group object. This fixes a
    possible crash caused by MUI itself if the screen is too small to take the
    resized window in case the preview image on the Look&Feel page is too big.
    Additionally this makes all pages look a bit more uniform.

2007-12-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * YAM.c: bumped minimum required version for codesets.library and
    BetterString.mcc to the latest available version.

2007-12-18  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * doc/YAM_english.guide: Made some more changes, added a section in
    Configuration about the Spam filter.

2007-12-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_MA.c: in case the user wanted old mails to be deleted upon startup and
    the current folder was not the trash folder, then the trash folder was not
    updated after the complete cleanup process. Only a click on the trash folder
    itself would immediately update the treeview item. Maybe this also fixes
    bug #1822876.

2007-12-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * locale/english-british.ct: added a first primilary version of a british
    english translation of our internal catalog.
  * deutsch.ct: minor adaptions/fixes.
  * YAM_MA.c: fixed bug #1851175 where removing the last mail from a folder
    didn't hide the attachment group.
  * YAM_MA.c, YAM_WR.c, WriteAttachmentList.c: fixed bug #1851566 where
    forwarding or drag&dropping a mail from a compressed folder as an
    attachment ended up in having the mail attached in compressed/encrypted
    form rather than in plain text.

2007-12-17  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * doc/YAM_english.guide: Changed a little bit here and there, info about
    developers/contributors, SVN access, required third party software and
    version/copyright numbers.

2007-12-16  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>
