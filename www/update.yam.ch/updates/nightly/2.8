2012-12-21 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mui/WriteWindow.c: prevent the autosave mechanism from closing the matchwindows
    of recipientstring objects. Otherwise the windows are closed and the string
    are being resolved when a user enters data in one of the recipientstring objects
    and the autosave mechanism is fired.

2012-12-20 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mui/YAMApplication.c: if helpFile is NULL we use the default help path instead
    of ignoring the help requests completely.

2012-12-20 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/RecipientString.c: alias expansion will always add the " >> " markers
    before the possible expanded string and pressing the right cursor key will
    take the current recipient as it is and add a comma at the end. Furthermore
    the entered addresses will be resolved only if the address match window is
    currently open. This closes #357.

2012-12-06 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * locale/swedish.ct: updated according to changes.

2012-12-06 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/WriteWindow.c: reworked the mail part encoding selection once more to
    still use base64 as last resort, but to prefer quoted-printable and 8bit
    encoding if possible.

2012-12-04 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * tcp/Connection.c: fixed DupHostEnt() function by using memdup() instead of
    strdup() to clone the h_addr_list of a struct hostent. This closes #359.

2012-12-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_COg.c: slightly relayouted the Read and Write config pages to make a bit
    more clearer that the font settings' check marks do not belong to other
    neighbouring objects, i.e. the pen settings on the Read page.
  * YAM.c: make sure that FACTS is actually running when checking for it as a
    trustable DST tool.
  * YAM_UT.c: use WBCTRLA_DuplicateSearchPath on MorphOS as well. According to
    the latest Ambient sources this is implemented in MorphOS 3.1.
  * YAM_UT.c: in case neither workbench.lib V44+ is available nor YAM was started
    from a shell to have a valid CommandLineInterface structure the CLI structure
    of the Workbench will be cloned now to obtain the global search path. This
    mostly probably applies to AmigaOS 3.1 only.
  * mui/WriteWindow.c: removed yet another no-op page switch was formerly done to
    workaround a MUI bug. But since page switching is not required at all when
    saving the mail for sending or as draft this should cause no harm.

2012-12-03 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * tcp/Connection.c: connections can new be created without opening a socket in
    case just a connection structure is required but no network access will
    happen, i.e. when importing mails. Thanks to Steffen Gutmann for the hint.
  * mui/WriteWindow.c: don't trigger any notifications when setting the write
    window's active page while saving the mail to the Drafts or Outgoing folder
    as this would change the active object. This is quite annoying if one was
    still typing the subject and YAM suddently activates the mail editor. This
    closes #360.
  * YAM.c: moved the initial DST check to a place where timezone.library is
    already opened, otherwise the AmigaOS4 build is not able to detect a
    trustable DST facility.

2012-12-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_AB.c: when trying to load the .addressbook file YAM will show an error
    message only if the file exists but could not be opened.

2012-12-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/WriteWindow.c: in case no subject was entered when sending a mail the
    user will now gets presented a requester with a second chance to enter the
    subject. This closes #355.

2012-11-30 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mui/InfoBar.c: added missing string.h include as stricmp() is defined there.
    This should fix the broken AROS builds.

2012-11-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/MailTextEdit.c: pen numbers obtained by MUI_ObtainPen must be converted
    by MUIPEN() before they can be used for graphic function calls. Unfortunately
    all versions of TextEditor.mcc <= 15.39 don't do this internally.
  * mui/InfoBar.c: slightly reverted the last change to the info bar as this
    seems to make MUI on MorphOS to go crazy.
  * resources/themes/empty: added the "empty" theme as official theme.
