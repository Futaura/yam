2013-12-21 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * locale/swedish.ct: updated to the latest changes.

2013-12-21 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * src/mui/InfoBar.c, src/mui/QuickSearchBar.c: we use MakeCloseButton()
    now for all situations where we had "X"-based close buttons to provide
    functionality to abort a process.
  * src/tcp/pop3.c: fixed some PushMethodOnStack() calls having used an
    incorrect number for specifying how many arguments will follow.
  * src/tcp/pop3.c, locale/YAM.cd, locale/german.ct: while just checking for
    mails, YAM will now show a "Checking mails from..." instead of calling
    in "Mail Transfer from..." as this might be misleading. This closes #478.
  * src/Busy.c: fixed a potential problem with calling BusyEnd() from a thread
    and awaiting it to be processed immediately so that the BusyNode can be
    NULLed afterwards. Now BusyEnd() will use PushMethodOnStackWait() instead
    to secure that situation.
  * src/mui/MainMailList.c: the dynamically generated short help for each 
    mail in the mail list will now also show "(No Recipients)" and 
    "(No Subject)" in case one if that information is missing.
  * resources/zoneinfo, tools/tzdata, tools/tzcode: updated tzdata/tzcode
    environment to the latest version (2013i) released by iana.org.
  * src/AddressBook.c, src/TZone.c, src/YAM.c: fixed some MorphOS' related
    compiler warnings.

2013-12-20 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * YAM.c: added "NBitmap.mcc" as a required dependency.
  * mui/Aboutwindow.c: added a "Make a donation" button to the About window
    to attract more people to make a direct donation to our project since
    the number of donations seem to decrease somewhat.

2013-12-19 Samir Hawamdeh <s.hawamdeh@tin.it>

  * locale/italian.ct: update to the latest changes.

2013-12-19 Alexandre Balaban <abalaban@free.fr>

  * locale/french.ct: updated according to latest changes.
  * doc/YAM_french.guide: updated according to latest changes.

2013-12-19 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * YAM_MA.c: fixed a problem when the autosave functionality of a write
    window kicked in and afterwards the write window was discarded and
    thus the mail deleted again from the drafts folders. This consistently
    caused a crash when afterwards attempting to load another large index
    file of another folder. The problem seems to be with the new
    RemoveMailFromFolder() function which it directly removed the freed
    the mail pointer instead of MA_DeleteSingle() doing that job.

2013-12-18 Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * locale/czech.ct: updated Czech translation.

2013-12-18 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * YAM.c: bumped the minimum required versions of TheBar.mcc and
    TextEditor.mcc to the latest available versions since they fix
    some important bugs related to YAM.

2013-12-17 Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * locale/swedish.ct: updated to the latest changes.

2013-12-17 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * mui/WriteWindow.c, misc: partly reverted the recent change to the
    ComposeMail function which was changed to always close a write window
    after any operation. Now the function will take an additional argument
    to allow to define if the function should close a window or not after
    the desired operation. This allowed to fix a problem where upon
    autosaving a mail the window was always closed. This closes #474.

2013-12-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_UT.c: added some output whether opening a URL was successful or not.

2013-12-16 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * YAM_WR.c: fixed the partly broken reply routines not correctly respecting
    the Mail-Reply-To: and Mail-Followup-To: headers by now correctly taking
    preference of these two headers and explicitly asking the user if he either
    wants to reply-to-sender or reply-to-all. This closes #454.

2013-12-16 Samir Hawamdeh <s.hawamdeh@tin.it>

  * locale/italian.ct: fixed some more strings.
  * TRANSLATION: updated to the recent checkout url.
