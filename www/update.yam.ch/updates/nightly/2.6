2010-02-20 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * ImageCache.c: images were drawn on AROS with pink border instead of
    transparent.

2010-02-18 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * themes/default: replaced the OS3 specific icons once more by a set which now
    definitely includes two images per icon.

2010-02-16 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: replaced all IsListEmpty() occurances by IsMinListEmpty() checks when
    a MinList is involved. This allowed to remove some unnecessary cast operations.
  * YAM_UT.c, Rexx.c: fixed some compiler warnings about strict aliasing rules
    which happen in case YAM is compiled with GCC 4.4.x.

2010-02-10 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mui/Aboutwindow.c: added a reference to expat.library which is used to allow
    importing an XML addressbook file.

2010-02-08 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/MainMailList.c: the context menu's "Set status to" entries are now
    enabled/disabled in respect to the number of selected mails. For a single
    mail the menu items reflect the current state of the mail and opposite items
    will be disabled. For multiple mails opposite items will both be enabled
    (i.e. "read" and "unread") to give the user the chance to modify the status
    independent of the clicked mail. This fixes bug #2177452.

2010-02-02  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * locale/czech.ct: removed diacritics from AUTH chunk text
  * mui/Aboutwindow.c: added myself to the list of translators; hopefully you
    don't mind :)

2010-02-01 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * themes/default: replaced the old planar icons for OS3 by the new icons done
    by Martin 'Mason' Merz.

2010-01-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Themes.c: each system now tries to obtain a system specific icon from the
    theme (i.e. icon/new_os4.info). If that fails YAM will fall back to the
    normal unspecific icon (i.e. icon/new.info). This makes it possible to
    distribute system specific icons like the new big icons from AmigaOS4.1
    update 1 with a theme without forcing users of other systems without on-the-
    fly icon scaling to use these big icons.
  * themes/default: added separate icons for all supported platforms. For OS4
    the new big icons will be used, MorphOS and AROS will use dual image PNG
    icons and OS3 will default to plain Amiga icons.

2010-01-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/Aboutwindow.c, doc/YAM_english.guide, doc/YAM_french.guide: added
    Matthias Rustler to the list of developers.
  * mui/Aboutwindow.c, doc/YAM_english.guide, doc/YAM_french.guide: added
    Antonis Iliakis to the list of translators.

2010-01-25 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * themes/default: updated the default theme to use the imagery used with OS4.1
    update 1. This is about 99% an AISS theme without the need to install AISS.
    Many thanks to Martin 'Mason' Merz for his work!
  * locale/#?: fixed some inconsistencies with trailing dots.
  * doc/Install-YAM: fixed the wrong path of muimaster.library for MorphOS in
    the MUI version check.

2010-01-15 Samir Hawamdeh <s.hawamdeh@tin.it>

  * locale/italiano.ct: minor corrections on the italian translation.

2010-01-14  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * doc/Install-YAM: updated Czech part of the installer script

2010-01-13 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: reverted the changes of revision 4473 where Thore forced all
    NListview objects to always carry a vertical scrollbar no matter what.
    While this fixed the graphics corruption symptoms reported lately,
    it does not seem to be a wise decision to work around this issue in
    YAM when the root of the problem is known to be originating from NList.
    We really need to fix that in NList later, so to allow YAM to benefit
    from further NList improvements it is better not to force YAM to
    use vertical scrollers at all times.

2010-01-11 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/AttachmentImage: fixed the non-OS4 builds by defining the unknown
    ICONGETA_SizeBounds tag as TAG_IGNORE.
