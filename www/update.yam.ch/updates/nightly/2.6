2009-11-02 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_TR.c: raised minimum required version of application.library for the
    new notification system to 53.7 due to recent SDK changes.

2009-10-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_MAf.c: modified the address line validation once more to perform the
    validation only if the mail was created by certain Microsuck products.

2009-10-29 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/WriteWindow.c: enhanced the command placeholder expansion such that it
    is now able to add closing quotes at the correct place even if the place-
    holder is followed by some other characters. For example '%a.lha' will be
    expanded to '"foo bar.lha"' instead of '"foo bar".lha' if 'foo bar' is to
    be inserted.

2009-10-28 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Requesters.c: all requesters can now be aborted by sending a CTRL-C and YAM
    can be uniconified by sending a CTRL-F while a requester is active.
  * YAM_TR.c: if no password is given for a POP3 account YAM will make sure the
    application is visible before prompting for a password. Otherwise there is
    no way to uniconify YAM and enter the password.
  * misc: added a convenience macro to make sure that NULL strings can safely be
    printed out.

2009-10-27 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_WR.c: when constructing a fully qualified mail address from given person
    data YAM now makes sure that at least either the real name or the address
    string exist. Before empty strings resulted in "half" addresses only like
    "@domain" instead of "name <user@domain>". Thanks to Christoph Poelzl for all
    his hints and testing.
  * YAM_MAf.c: fixed some NULL pointer accesses when one of the header lines was
    empty.
  * YAM_MAf.c: rewrote the address handling when parsing the header lines again
    from scratch. The new approach correctly handles multiple possibly broken
    recipient addresses which the old one didn't. I hate this broken Microsuck
    stuff :(

2009-10-26 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_MA.c: YAM complained about an unknown file format when trying to import
    plain .mbox files which contained a mail without subject as the very first
    mail. Now at least 2 out of 3 known header lines (From, To, Subject) will
    suffice to make YAM recognize such a file as a valid .mbox file.

2009-10-26  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * locale/swedish.ct: updated according to changes.

2009-10-25 Samir Hawamdeh <s.hawamdeh@tin.it>

  * locale/italiano.ct: Various minor changes on the italian translation.

2009-10-21 Samir Hawamdeh <s.hawamdeh@tin.it>

  * locale/italiano.ct: Added missing string (MSG_CO_TEXTCOLORS_READ), this should
    fix bugs #2874442 and #2874431
  * doc/Install-YAM: Added italian language as "Setting up" option, this need some
    more testing before 2.6 final release.
  * doc/YAM_english.guide: Add Samir Hawamdeh and Luca Longone as contributors for
    the italian translation :-)

2009-10-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * doc/YAM_english.guide: rewrote the section about the single mail file names.
    This fixes bug #2869911.
  * Debug.c: the debug log now contains the build date instead of the
    (currently) empty build ID.
  * YAM_UT.c: added some debug output to the address generation function when
    replying to a mail to track down a bug with slightly broken addresses.
  * YAM_WR.c: added some debug output to the address generation function when
    replying to a mail to track down a bug with slightly broken addresses.
  * mui/WriteWindow.c: all filenames containing spaces which may be passed to
    external commands will now correctly be sourrounded with quotes.
  * YAM_CO.c: added ".lha" to the %a paramter of the default packer command
    string.
  * extrasrc/Get#?.c: removed the ENTER()/RETURN() macros from the list/node
    functions, because a @ctrace log become far too huge and unmaintainable
    with these.

2009-10-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mime/rfc2047.c, mime/rfc2231.c: in case a conversion fails the source and
    destination codeset name will now be printed out in the debug log as well.

2009-10-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_MAf.c: fixed a possible endless loop in the recently added workaround.
