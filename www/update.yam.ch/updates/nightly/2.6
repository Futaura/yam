2008-02-27  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_TR.c: the incoming folder's treenode is now redrawn after each received
    mail. First of all this is consistent to sending mails and redrawing the
    outgoing folder's treenode, and it gives instant feedback even without a
    transfer window. Scrolling in folder treeview while a transfer was in
    progress did this redraw already as well as making the folder treeview
    inactive and active again.

2008-02-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * ParseEmail.l, HTML2Mail.l: added a minimum flex version requirement check
    to the lexer files. This is requires so that on one hand we have a unified
    build environment throughout our developers and because the latest official
    flex version (2.5.35) fixes some important issues. This should prevent
    building YAM with ancient flex versions known to be buggy.

2008-02-26  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc classes: added the same "event handler added" check to all other
    classes which could possibly walk into the same trap as AttachmentImage.
  * AttachmentImage.c: fixed a potential crash in case a mail had a yet
    undecoded attachment and YAM was iconified and uniconfied while this mail
    was currently being displayed. In this case the event handler was not added
    during MUIM_Setup, but removed in MUIM_Cleanup, which can cause any kind of
    funny things to happen. Most probably this fixes bug #1899484.
  * misc: various little code cleanups, no functional changes.

2008-02-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_FO.c: the last fix didn't work exactly as intended.
  * YAM_FO.c: searching for a folder no longer relys on the graphical represen-
    tation by the folder listtree, but uses the list of folders directly.

2008-02-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Makefile: reworked the compilation output to not use any ANSI color output
    as that messes with some terminals not properly supporting ANSI. In
    addition we use "make -C" from now on to walk into subdirectory
    compilation. Furthermore, the Arexx date calculation routines are now
    used for native OS4 hosted compiles as the gdate based calculation didn't
    work out as it seems.

2008-02-22  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_COs.c: make sure the first entry of the MIME list is really visible and
    not just active.
  * Threads.c: in case YAM was aborted early (i.e. a missing .mcc) the thread
    subsystem was cleaned up nevertheless and caused crashes, because
    uninitialized lists were accessed. Now a proper check is done before then
    cleanup. This fixes bug #1899531.

2008-02-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * MailList.c, YAM_UT.c: moved the locking of the mail list in some functions
    more to the front to avoid accessing a non-locked list. Also moved the list
    locking into MailListToMailArray().
  * YAM_MA.c: added a warning/error message when no active/selected or new mail
    could be found upon creating such a list of mails.
  * YAM_MA.c: slightly changed how the number of actually deleted mails is
    counted to be more obvious.
  * YAM_MA.c: added some more debug code when deleting mails.
  * YAM_MAf.c: changed two debugging macros to the correct class.

2008-02-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM.c: changing the active mail, which requires the active folder to be set,
    doesn't make any sense before the folder list is loaded at all. This caused
    the "Spam" button to be shown in disabled state right after starting YAM,
    because there was no active mail nor an active folder.

2008-02-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Mime.c: fixed bug #1897222 where under certain circumstances the RFC2047
    header encoding routines failed when line wrapping occurred due to the
    encoding word limits.

2008-02-18  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * BayesFilter.c: having rethought the stuff, the address book is not longer
    searched for the real name of a mail's sender as this is too easy to forge.

2008-02-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_MA.c: old mails are no longer deleted immediately but copied over to a
    temporary "to be deleted" list first. This avoids locking a folder's mail
    list twice (or even more often), which seems to produce deadlocks for some
    users. Also added some more debugging informations about mails to be
    deleted.
  * YAM_UT.c: some minor optimizations.
  * BayesFilter.c: in case the address book is considered as white list the
    sender's real name and address are now searched in the address book. This
    should improve the white listing a bit.


THIS IS JUST A 100 LINE STRIPPED VERSION OF THE CHANGELOG
