2008-02-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * Threads.c, misc: added a first preliminary port of the multithreading
    implementation of SimpleMail. Please note, that this is a first very basic
    and untested port of the multitasking/multithreading framework. Apart from
    the initialization routines it is currently not used at all in YAM. Further
    work is definitely required and I would suggest to first try to get that
    stuff running for one of our regular timer jobs (e.g. automatic index
    saving) to verify that this stuff actually works as expected. Afterwards
    we might try to use it for larger jobs like managing asynchronous TCP/IP
    connections.

  * YAM_FO.c: a newly created folder was never added to the new global list and
    even worse the folder pointer in the tree view still pointed to a no longer
    existing structure on the stack. This fixes bug #1887196.
  * YAM_UT.c: added some assertions to track down a possible bug in the folder
    maillist management.

2008-02-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_TR.c: the UIDL hash table will now only be saved if it was modified
    during the mail transfer. This fixes bug #1885491.

2008-02-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * ReadWindow.c: fixed the broken search for unread mails.

2008-01-31  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_MA.c: simplified the copying/moving of a mail a bit so that YAM doesn't
    have to handle yet another copy on the stack.
  * YAM_UT.c: made the debug log a bit more verbose upon copying/moving a file
    from one folder to an other one.
  * YAM_FO.c: fixed an "access after free()" bug.
  * ReadWindow.c, ReadMailGroup.c, YAM_RE.c: reverted the recent changes to the
    enabled state of the "Check PGP signature" menus. Only the signature of new
    mails will now be checked automatically. After that the user must invoke
    that action manually.
  * YAM_MA.c: optimized the creation of complete mail lists by using
    CloneMailList() instead of doing the dirty work ourself.
  * Debug.c: fixed a possible buffer overrun when starting time measurement
    clocks.
  * YAM_addressbookEntry.h: minor cosmetic changes.
  * misc: reconstructed the folder lists analog to the mail lists. All in all
    the folders are no longer managed by an NListtree object anymore but are
    kept in a real global list while the tree items just reference the single
    folders. Analog to mail list the global folder list can be locked either
    exclusively or shared, depending on whether the list is going to be modified
    or not. Creating clone copies therefore is no longer necessary.
  * misc: the mail lists can now be locked exclusively or shared, depending on
    whether the list is going to be modified or not.

2008-01-30  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * ReadWindow.c, ReadMailGroup.c: the "Check signature" menu item will now be
    disabled if the signature of a mail has been checked already, as YAM did
    prevent a double check anyway already.
  * YAM_UT.c: added the return code of PGP commands to the debug log.
  * AttachmentGroup.c: in case an attachment had no name but a description only
    the name of attachment image could be drawn over futher images to the right,
    because the width was calculated using the empty name instead of the
    description.

2008-01-28  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * locale/czech.ct: updated Czech translation.

2008-01-28  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * ImageCache.c: getting the BitMapHeader after the remapping process seems to
    to obtain wrong depth information (a depth compatible to the screen being
    remapped to instead of the true depth of the image) on OS4. Hence we obtain
    the BitMapHeader right after loading the image via datatypes.library now.
    This fixes bug #1876914.
  * YAM_MA.c: fixed a double lock of a mail list.

2008-01-27  Alexandre Balaban <balaban@free.fr>

  * locale/french.ct: french translation update according to latest changes.

2008-01-26  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * YAM_UT.c: a user folder was not deleted completely if there was a .signature
    file existing.
  * YAM.c: fixed the initial wrong folder icon display. The "new" icon was
    always shown if there were mails in the folder at all, instead of only if
    unread mails existed.

2008-01-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * YAM_md5.c, Mime.c: moved all md5 message digest function to the generalized
