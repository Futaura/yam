2011-12-23 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * YAM_FI.c: changed mail search window to also show a listtree
    rather than a plain list. Also changed the search window to not
    clear its mail list on exit and to also keep the same listtree
    selection when reopening the window. This should be a bit more
    intuitive in case a user want to return to the search window
    and see the old search results.

2011-12-21 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mui/FolderRequestListtree.c: implemented that custom folder image
    object will also be created for the FolderRequestListtree.
  * mui/FolderListtree, mui/FolderRequestListtree.c: implemented
    a base class for the folder listtree and changed the old
    FolderRequestList class to a Listtree class. In addition,
    MainFolderListtree is also now derived from the new
    FolderListtree class. In the end, this change allowed to 
    use a listtree rather than a plain list for the folder
    request window. Thus, this should close #136.

2011-12-18 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * YAM.c, YAM_EA.c: fixed some potentially critical DoMethod calls
    to NListtree which might have showed some problems.

2011-12-17 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mui/AddrBookListtree.c, MainFolderListtree.c: now that a new
    fixed NListtree.mcc is released the previously added workaround
    could be removed.
  * YAM.c: bumped all minimum required versions of all MCCs to what are
    the latest versions available as there are new features and fixes
    out there in these classes.
  * AVLTree.c: replace AllocVec/FreeVec calls with AllocVecPooled and
    FreeVecPooled as AllocVec/FreeVec are marked as deprecated in the
    latest OS4 SDK.
  * extrasrc: slightly revised some of our own implementation of standard
    C functions and tried to make them more compatible to version found
    in other projects. Especially the strtok_r() function should be somewhat
    more compatible to well-known implementations.

2011-12-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/AddrBookListtree.c, MainFolderListtree.c: fixed wrong usage of
    DoSuperMethod().

2011-12-16 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * extrasrc/strcasestr.c: renamed our own stristr() implementation to
    strcasestr() as that is the more well-known name for it. In addition, a
    slightly faster implementation is now in place. Furthermore, as MorphOS
    and AROS seem to have own strcasestr() implementations in their C libraries
    we give them preference for these platforms.
  * YAM_MA.c: changed the mail import requester to allow to select multiple
    files at once and start multiple mail file imports. Please note, however,
    that for every file there currently will be a separate preselection window
    opened as stuffing all mails from all selected files together will
    require more substantial work. Nevertheless, mail import from several mbox
    files are now possible. Thus, for the moment this closes #196.
  * locale/*.ct: fixed all catalog files to have "%s" added to the MSG_TR_MsgInFile
    entry or otherwise YAM can't add the name of the file the imported mails
    will be display in the import preselection window.

2011-12-15 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * HTML2Mail.l: reworked the main html2mail flex rules to behave somewhat more
    hierarchically. Previously the rules were pretty much mixed up. Now they
    should more cleanly convert a html mail (and especially embedded links)
    to a somewhat more readable text. This should finally closes #279.
  * mui/MainFolderListtree.c, mui/MainMailList.c: added PCS format statements to
    the MUIA_NList_Format specs of the MainFolderListtree and the MainMailList.
    This is a new feature of NList and will automatically substitute text with
    "..." at the position where text didn't fit into a column anymore. For the
    Folder Listtree the folder name will now be substitute centered and for
    the main mail list the Sender and Subject line will be substituted right
    aligned in case text doesn't fit anymore. Please test extensively! ;)

2011-12-15 Mariusz Danilewicz <mandi@interia.pl>

  * locale/polish.ct: update to the latest changes.

2011-12-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * mui/AddrBookListtree.c, MainFolderListtree.c: added a workaround for a bug
    in NListtree.mcc to avoid a NULL pointer access. This closes #281.

2011-12-09 Emilio Jimenez <ejim@ono.com>

  * locale/spanish.ct: update to the latest change.
