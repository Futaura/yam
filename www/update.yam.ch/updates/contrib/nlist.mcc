                           NList.mcc - 20.122
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NList.mcc is a MUI custom class used for managing large amount of data in
a list-type format. Together with other classes (e.g. NListviews.mcc) it
complements to a complete replacement for the builtin List classes of MUI.

The version that is advertised here is an important bugfixing update and
every YAM user is adviced to use this new version instead of the original
version supplied with the original YAM distribution.
