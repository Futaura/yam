                          openurl.library - 7.10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

openurl.library is a library to make it easier for application programmers
to include clickable URLs in their applications. It solves the problem by
giving application programmers a very simple API to handle (one function)
and the user gets configurability with the included preferences program.

The version that is advertised here is an important bugfixing update and
every YAM user is adviced to use this new version instead of the original
version supplied with the original YAM distribution.

For more information about the detail of changes in this version please
consult the ChangeLog file within the lha archive of openurl.library.
