CHANGES:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          NBalance.mcc - 15.24
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NBalance.mcc is a MUI custom class used as a replacement for the builtin
Balance class which allows to dynamically resize groups. NBalance is
based on the internal Balance class of MUI, but enhances it with some
important features such as custom mouse pointers.

The version that is advertised here is an important bugfixing update and
every YAM user is adviced to use this new version instead of the original
version supplied with the original YAM distribution.

For more information about the detail of changes in this version please
consult the ChangeLog file within the lha archive of NBalance.mcc.
