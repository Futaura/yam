This how-to assumes that you have enough experience to install and
setup svn and using the Shell.

First, you need to get the subversion client "svn" from AmiNET for OS3/OS4:

http://www.aminet.net/package.php?package=dev/misc/subversion-1.1.4.lha

After that, you can go and do a checkout by doing something like this:

 cd "where you want to store the files"
 svn co https://yamos.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/yamos/trunk yamos

This will checkout the sources from our "trunk" to your local directory
"yamos".

Now you can go into the "locale" subdir and change the *.ct file for your
language in there. (Don't change the directory layout and such!)
However, you need to make sure you keep the following in mind:

 1. Always do a "svn update" in that "yamos" directory right before your
 next change or checkin so that you make sure you get the very
 latest changes.
 2. Always bump the revision and date of your *.ct file before you
 checkin your changes, back to the repository, that's very important!
 3. Always adapt the "ChangeLog" yourself by adding an entry to it
 right before you checkin.

After you have done your changes you might do a "svn status" in the
"yamos" directory and subversion should tell you which files you changed.
And after that you could even do a "svn diff" in the directory and
subversion should show you a diff file with the particular local changes
you have made.

If you then add a comment to the ChangeLog you can do a "svn commit" in the
directory "yamos" and subversion will prompt you for a log message.
This should open c:Ed and here you should add a comment, same like you added
to the ChangeLog file. It will also show you which files have been changed.
After that you will be promted for login/password and after that
you are done!

In the future you do not need to do a checkout again, all you need to do,
to update it, is:

 cd "your yamos directory"
 svn update

Good luck translating YAM!
